#### Abstract

Project Abstract African swine fever is a devastating disease present in much of the African continent, where it impedes the development of the pig sector due to regular wipe-outs of pig herds in the affected countries. It is also a massive problem in Asia, as the virus has recently spread from Eastern Europe to China and subsequently to Vietnam and Cambodia. The virus is a large doublestranded DNA virus in the Asfaviridae family, with pox viruses as the closest relatives. The present project is an extension of the Phase 1 project, where the goal was to establish vaccine platform technologies to genetically modify the African swine fever virus (ASFV). The final objectives for this project were to provide a proof-of-concept for efficacy and for safety of vaccine candidates in the target species. The CRISPR-Cas editing approach. In the Phase 1 LVIF project, a CRISPR Cas9 editing system for African swine fever was established at ILRI and published (Abkallo et al. 2021). Using this system, about 10 different viruses with gene deletions have been produced. They have been fully sequenced and grown up in stock and titered for use in animals. For several of them, growth kinetics have been performed to assess the growth compared to the wild-type virus. The wild-type virus (ASFV-Kenya1033), which is a genotype IX strain isolated from Kenya, was initially characterized in depth for virulence in animals after adaptation to the wild boar cell line (WSL) where it is genetically stable and grew to high titers. It is still virulent in animals. This work was published in Hemmink et al. 2022a. Thereafter, a CD2v deletion virus was tested in pigs. This virus was attenuated' but not sufficiently as the pigs had various ASF-related side effects during the immunization. However, all 8 pigs made it through, and 87\% protection of animals was achieved (Hemmink et al. 2022b). We added a deletion of the A238L gene, which had given partially attenuation in a prior experiment, to the CD2v deletion virus. When

tested in pigs, this resulted in a very attenuated virus, but this compromised the protection which went down to 50\% (Abkallo et al. 2021). We then constructed several other viruses, a 6 gene deletion mutant where the MGF 360.12L14L and MGF505.1R-3R genes were deleted (ASFV-Kenya1033- $\triangle$ MGF360-505), a 3 gene deletion mutant where the MGF 360.12L-14L genes were deleted (ASFV-Kenya1033 $\triangle$ MGF12L14L), a mutant with either a deletion of A238L (ASFV-Kenya1033 $\triangle A 238 L$ ) or a deletion of I329L (ASFVKenya1033- $\Delta 1329 \mathrm{~L}$ ) or a deletion of 317L (ASFV-Kenya1033- $\Delta \mathrm{F} 317 \mathrm{~L}$ ) or a deletion of F334L (ASFV-Kenya1033- $\Delta \mathrm{F} 334 \mathrm{~L}$ ) or a deletion of I226R (ASFV-Kenya1033- $\Delta 1226 \mathrm{R}$ ). Several of these deletions were also added to the CD2v knockout to create double deletions. Nine different modified viruses were tested in pigs for attenuation and protection. If too many animals didn't pass the attenuation, they would not be challenged. This led to 2 vaccine candidates with a good safety profile and high level of protection. The first candidate that was found was the 6 gene deletion mutant, ASFV-Kenya1033- $\Delta$ MGF360-505, which has shown $87 \%$ protection upon challenge with the wild-type virus (ASFVKenya1033) when combining two experiments using one injection with 103 TCID50 (16 animals in all). Protection was also seen in other doses. The second candidate harbors a deletion of the 3 F317L gene. This gene has been suggested to inhibit the NFkappa B pathway, interfering with the innate immune system. This vaccine candidate conferred $66 \%$ protection using a dose of 103 TCID50. Increasing the dose to 104 TCID50 resulted in 100\% protection in the last experiment in the project. It also had a very favorable safety profile which matched the PBS control. Some animals had some joint swelling after challenge - but, that was all. A further dose titration is suggested to see if either less virus or more virus can circumvent this. The synthetic assembly approach. With regards to the synthetic approach, in the Phase 1 LVIF project, we first developed a self-helper virus boot-up system for ASFV. The system is based on inhibiting replication of one ASFV strain in mammalian cells and using its proteins to boot up the genome of another ASFV strain to generate live virus. The proof of principle was demonstrated using ASFV-Armenia or ASFV-NHV as the helper virus to boot up the ASFVKenya1033 endogenous genome (isolated from virus), taking advantage of the observation that CRISPR-Cas9 cleaved the targeted p30 gene in ASFV-Armenia or ASFVNHV, thereby inhibiting replication of these strains, but not ASFV-Kenya1033 due to sequence polymorphisms in thep30 gene. With this success, we then established a synthetic genomics genome assembly approach for ASFV-Kenya1033 by first, "deconstructing" the genome into 12 overlapping fragments in silico, then cloning the 12 individual fragments by transformation-associated recombination (TAR) in yeast and finally assembling a full ASFV-Kenya1033 genome from either thirds or half genomes that were assembled from the appropriate 12 cloned fragments. However, when the recombinant full genome was transfected into mammalian cells, the resulting virus had a growth defect likely due to incorrect hairpin ends of the genome. Thus, in Phase 2, the selfhelper virus boot-up system was modified such that ASFV-Kenya1033 virus itself was used to boot up the recombinant ASFV-Kenya1033 genome. To make this work, we modified the p12 gene at the part level so that it would be immune to cleavage by CRISPR-Cas9. The recombinant ASFV-Kenya1033 genome containing this p12 modification was booted-up by the ASFVKenya1033 self-helper virus and the resulting

--- Page 2 ---

recombinant virus grew with wild-type growth characteristics. With this success, we then used the synthetic approach to generate numerous mutant ASFV-Kenya1033 virus strains. In all, we assembled 37 synthetic full genomes. Of these, we transfected 20 genomes and generated 12 different ASFV-Kenya1033 mutant viruses. For the other 8 transfected genomes, it is likely that they contained deletions of essential genes. In summary, through Phases 1 and 2 of this project, we have successfully developed a synthetic genomics-based reverse genetics system for ASFV to make recombinant mutant viruses. However, we are continuing to optimize the system so that we can use ASFV genotype strains other than the ASFV-Kenya1033 strain.

# Project Highlights 

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?
2. Generation of candidate vaccines including freedom to operate. Many genedeleted viruses from both the synthetic genomics assembly and CRISPR-Cas approaches, of which 2 can be regarded as vaccine candidates. These both have very favorable safety profiles, with one seeming to be exceptionally safe. There is up to $100 \%$ protection, as seen with the second candidate (F317L). Growth ability has been assessed of these candidates; both are able to grow (without optimization) up to at least $10^{7}$ TCID50.
3. The patent status of the two vaccine candidates has been evaluated. The 6 gene deletion has been done previously in Genotype I and II and Pirbright has a patent on this deletion, which doesn't seem to extend to Africa. Therefore, such a vaccine candidate may be more interesting to take to governmental bodies rather than private sector companies. The $\Delta \mathrm{F} 317 \mathrm{~L}$ candidate does not seem to be patented, so this may be more interesting for private sector companies. Researchers are trying to obtain further funding for making this deletion in the Genotype II background that circulates currently in Europe and Asia.
4. CRISPR-Cas editing approach was successfully established in Phase I and we have generated a vast number of modified viruses using this approach in Phase II. Some could not be cloned and some were not tested in animals (double knockout with CD2v) because it was found out that CD2v compromised the protection. Eight single knock-out viruses and one double knock-out virus were tested in pigs, some in various doses and two vaccine candidates have been identified.
5. Synthetic genomics assembly was successfully established the synthetic genomics assembly approach for ASFV in Phase I and have generated numerous mutant viruses, including ones with multiply deleted genes at various loci. However, these have not yet been tested in animal models. In addition, we have assembled a number of genomes that could not be rescued into live virus, suggesting that these genes are essential in ASFV-Kenya1033.

Finally, the team were still working on optimizing this approach to minimize any potential recombination between the recombinant donor genome and the self-helper virus.

3. If appropriate, explain why outputs were not completed or were of poor quality. Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

With regards to the technical gaps, the following points are of importance: $\cdot$ Although evidence of homologous protection has been obtained with a CRISPR generate ASFV vaccine, the project has not considered that as a Proof of concept. Some of the studies being planned are part of the Exploratory development and should have been planned to be undertaken in line with appropriate guidelines.

- The lack of heterologous protection should be further studied given the fact that the vaccine is being design for endemic regions of East Africa where more than one genotype generally circulates. It may be important to prioritise the development of an ASF genotype $X$ vaccine using the CRISPR Cas technology, so that the two most dominant ASF genotypes in East Africa can be combined into a vaccine. Such bivalent vaccine, after confirmation of its overall efficacy, could be taken through the full

development process and lead to an effective vaccine, while further work would be taking place for the development of a synthetic biology derived vaccine.

# PROJECT OUTCOMES 

## 4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

The research was important to fund because outbreaks of African swine fever (ASF) have caused devastating losses to the global pig industry. Pigs immunized with ASFV attenuated virus can resist the lethal challenge of a strongly virulent virus.
The research results are being published and there are still several publications to finish at the end of this project. This will influence other researchers and their choices of gene deletions in their vaccine developments against African swine fever. Certain improvements in the virus cloning procedure have been published that can be taken up by other researchers. In addition, the synthetic genomics assembly approach is expected to be published and will enable much more rapid and sophisticated modification of ASFV which could be adopted by the ASFV community to facilitate vaccine development.

## 5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

The final objectives for this project are to provide a proof of concept for efficacy and safety of vaccine candidates in the target species. Expected outcomes: 1) Generation of ASF vaccine synthetic candidates, 2) Demonstration of attenuation of vaccine candidates in target species, and 3) Demonstration of efficacy in swine Immunization and challenge experiments.

All milestones were achieved according to the team. However, the team expended significant time conducting a series of experiments that proved to be inconsequential. This includes synthetic biology, which should be placed on hold while efforts are focused on developing an effective CRISPR Cas-based bivalent ASF IX and X. To make this vaccine acceptable for the "largest possible market" there is a need to develop a complete new recombinant ASF vaccine which will also protect against the most relevant genotypes. In Austral Africa (including South Africa) the most important genotype is II, but there also other genotypes circulating: III; IV; V; VI; VII; XIX, XX; XXIII. In West and Central Africa, the most important is genotype I. In Europe, the most important genotype is II. The recombinant live attenuated ASF vaccine, which is actually developed in this project, will only have a very restricted market (mostly only Uganda and Kenya).

The project team requested that IDRC provide additional funding for experiments to validate the proof of concept for a vaccine, focusing on the two most prevalent ASF genotypes in East Africa, i.e., genotype IX and X. However, the project is scheduled to be terminated as the program concluded in December 2023.

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

- The COVID lockdown introduced major delays to project progress as lab were closed for extended times during complete lockdowns in Kenya and FLI. This was mitigated by granting a 12-month no-cost extension to February 2022.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

## Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

This project was funded through the Livestock Vaccine Innovation Fund (LVIF), which was cofunded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), Global Affairs Canada (GAC) and IDRC. The fund was a 57\$ CAD partnership of 8 years. It ended in March 2024. LVIF adopted a strategic model that intervened at key entry points in the vaccine development, production, and access continuum. The Fund carried out research activities along three broad streams: cuttingedge vaccine development, vaccine improvement and manufacturing, and vaccine demand, access, and use. In the cutting-edge vaccine development stream, IDRC launched an open call for proposal that funded very upstream research projects. It was decided to fund a second phase of these successful projects, if they could demonstrate that they had reached proof of concept in

--- Page 7 ---

the first phase. This process included a very rigorous review by IDRC staff as well as external reviewers from the private sector. The Fund supported eight projects through the initial discovery phase covering novel vaccine development for a range of livestock diseases (e.g. African Swine Fever, Avian Flu, and Foot and Mouth Disease), with several promising projects subsequently given Phase 2 funding to take the vaccines towards industry proof of concept. Grantees at this phase are primarily research institutes and universities. Overall, LVIF has thus far had mixed success and underperformed against its key long-term outcome targets, which were quite ambitious and therefore difficult to achieve. However, although there are only a few examples of newly validated vaccine candidates and market ready vaccines so far, there has been some progress towards proof of concept for the majority of phase 2 projects.
This specific LVIF project aimed to engineer the African swine fever virus using synthetic biology to accelerate vaccine development, with a focus on establishing vaccine platform technologies and providing proof-of-concept for vaccine efficacy and safety. The project successfully generated candidate vaccines with favorable safety profiles, established CRISPR-Cas editing and synthetic genomics assembly approaches, and identified two vaccine candidates with high levels of protection. However, the project faced challenges such as the lack of heterologous protection and the need for further optimization of the synthetic biology approach. Recommendations included focusing on developing a bivalent ASF vaccine for genotypes IX and X. The need to find an efficacious vaccine against African Swine Fever is dire as now, no vaccine or medicine are available for this fatal pig disease. In most LMICs countries, whole swine herds are sacrificed if disease is detected. Even though the research team didn't succeed in proving heterologous protection, it contributed significantly to the use of synthetic biology and gene reconstruction in vaccine development

# Director comments 

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

The challenge of finding effective vaccines for, and prevention of African Swine Fever remains enormous, as is the impact of outbreaks globally. This project highlights this challenge and the research partners signal the opportunities that lie in continuing their work, which goes beyond just finding a suitable vaccine, but also requires international cooperation and capacity strengthening in the use of technologies and their transfer toward marketability.

I look forward to our discussions and planning toward IDRC's contributions to animal production within a food systems resilience and lens.

There remain some opportunities to add to the lessons learned from this project upon the return of the responsible officer from leave, however I commend the LVIF team and approve this PCR.
