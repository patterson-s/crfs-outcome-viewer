Project Abstract

--- Page 1 ---

Bovine Babesiosis is a protozoan disease of cattle, water, and African buffaloes. It is caused by Babesia bovis, a parasite transmitted by Rhipicephalus ticks. This parasite hides in red blood cells and evades immune responses resulting in a persistent infection that often results in death. Babesiosis occurs in many parts of the world where ticks are present, including Africa and Asia.

Its prevalence and incidence are often underestimated. Economic studies have estimated annual losses in India and Tanzania at US\$ 57 million and US\$ 46 million, respectively. Current vaccines against babesiosis consist of live attenuated pathogens that are produced from the blood of infected animals, although parasites grown in the lab are also available as vaccines in some parts of Latin America. While vaccination of young animals results in solid lifelong immunity, current vaccines are not safe as they may cause adult animals to become infectious, may be contaminated with other pathogens, or cause hypersensitivity reactions.

This project was designed to develop a vaccine that is safe and provides efficacy in two different ways. The first is to develop a vaccine that will block parasite infection of host capillary blood vessels and disrupt transmission by tick vectors. Secondly, scientists are aiming to produce a vaccine that is safer than the current commercial vaccines with little or no side effects and without the risk of inducing a patent infection in vaccinated animals. In phase I, using cutting-edge bioinformatics and experimental platforms, the project tested B. bovis red blood cell surfaceexposed proteins for their ability to induce antibodies that block the adhesion of infected blood cells to blood vessel walls and hence could prevent acute disease. Similarly, bioinformatic tools were used to identify conserved B. bovis candidate antigens exclusively expressed in the tick stages of the life cycle of the parasite. In this second phase of this project, the team aims to validate and improve the protective efficacy of the candidate vaccine antigens. The expected result is a dual-acting subunit vaccine capable of preventing parasite transmission, thus cutting the expansion of the lethal B. bovis parasites in the field via competent ticks and ameliorating the effect of acute and severe babesiosis once infection occurs.

# PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS 

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

- The research team produced and tested five blood-stage antigens for their potential as subunit vaccine candidates in cattle against a geographically distinct virulent isolate of $B$. bovis (S74-T3Bo) in the USA. New blood-stage antigens (BbSA7, BbSA8, BbSA9, BbSA10, BbSA11, BbSA12, BbSA13, BbSA14, BbSA15, BbSA16, and BbSA18) were also produced as recombinant proteins in mammalian cells (Expi 293) or E. coli for further assessment as potential new vaccine candidate antigens.
- The team redefined the N -terminus of 11 C 5 by sequencing previously unsequenced regions of the genome and produced two recombinant proteins (the C-terminal end of 11C5 and the newly identified N -terminal end of 11C5) in E. coli for further biochemical and immunological characterization and to further understand the role of 11C5 in parasite biology and clinical disease.
- The research team published four papers and two invited reviews in peer-reviewed international journals describing our work in this project.

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study/research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

--- Page 4 ---

Developing vaccines against vector-borne diseases has become a challenge for the research community. Tick-borne diseases cause significant losses to the livestock sector, especially for smallholder farmers who are already dealing with various crises related to sub-Saharan Africa's context. Following promising results obtained during the first phase of the project, the research team has secured funding to develop a vaccine against babesiosis that will not only protect against blood infection but also prevent the transmission of the parasites. The research team, composed of experienced researchers from Australia and the USA, identified and produced recombinant proteins that have been tested for their potential as vaccine candidates. They characterized $B$. bovis blood-stage antigens (BbSA1, BbSA3, BbSA4, BbMAP1, and 11C5) and tick-stage antigens (HAP2) for their suitability to offer broad-range protection. The research team has expressed and purified the selected vaccine antigens in E. coli and tested the stability of freeze-dried vaccine antigens at different temperatures. The antigenicity, purity, and identity of vaccine antigens were also validated. Unfortunately, the ultimate experiment designed to test the dual-acting vaccine did not work because both vaccinated and non-vaccinated cattle developed clinical signs, and the team had to terminate the experiments. Nevertheless, the project team has generated significant technical knowledge disseminated via peer-reviewed publications that could serve the research community and guide the development of a future effective vaccine.

# 5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way? 

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

Phase 1 of this project (project ID 108525) focused on the discovery of novel blood-stage and tickstage vaccine antigens and claimed the demonstration of a preliminary proof of concept for bloodstage and tick-stage vaccines with the potential to prevent acute disease and transmission by ticks in cattle against virulent $B$. bovis infections.

This second phase of the project aimed to generate a dual-acting and easily deployable sub-unit recombinant vaccine that can protect cattle against acute babesiosis (a blood-stage vaccine) while also blocking transmission of the parasite between its tick vector and its host (a transmissionblocking vaccine) in endemic areas, particularly in Africa.

The team was not able to test the candidate and prove the dual-acting properties of their vaccine at the project's closure. Unfortunately, the project did not fulfill this objective, in part due to several delays, as explained in the challenges section. These included delays in securing the authorization to conduct the trial in South Africa and sourcing a B. bovis strain line suitable for the challenge experiment in South Africa. The research team requested and was granted the authorization to conduct a smaller-scale animal experiment in the USDA Pullan facility to save the project and have at least a proof of concept. However, the trial results were inconclusive because all the animals (vaccine and unvaccinated) showed severe signs of disease, which forced the team to euthanize the animals to avoid animal unnecessary suffering.

## 6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.
Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

Babesiosis is a devastating disease for the cattle farming industry, particularly negatively impacting men and women small-holder farmers from tropical and subtropical countries located in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The project offered a strategic opportunity for LVIF to support the

--- Page 5 ---

development of a cutting-edge vaccine for diseases that greatly affect livestock production systems in these regions.

This project addresses three of IDRC's strategic objectives. The project contributes to IDRC's Development Outcomes, especially "improved health for all" by promoting animal health solutions. This project also contributes to the Agriculture and Environment Implementation Plan, especially to "enhance economic empowerment" through improved farm livelihoods, particularly of livestock smallholders, which will ultimately contribute to Sustainable Development Goal 2 to end hunger. It also contributes to "strengthened knowledge generation and use," as this project generated evidence regarding the disease and the potential commercial vaccine. Additionally, knowledge generated in this project could be applicable to designing similar disease control strategies for other livestock tickborne diseases

## Meeting Project Objectives

On a scale of 1 to 4 (1 indicating that the project did not meet the objective and 4 indicating that it fully met the objective), please rate the achievement of each project objective.

General Objective: To produce a dual acting subunit vaccine against babesiosis that is practical and easily deployable in Babesia-endemic regions worldwide to prevent both acute disease in infected animals and parasite transmission by tick vectors.
$\square 4$ Fully met $\square 3$
$\boxtimes 2$
$\square 1$ Not met
Comment: The primary aim of the project was twofold: firstly, to confirm the effectiveness of certain protective antigens identified in the initial phase, ensuring they provide comprehensive protection against B. bovis strains from Africa and other regions where the disease is prevalent; secondly, to evaluate the performance of a dual-action subunit vaccine against a specific African strain of B. bovis in cattle. However, the contracted research organization (CRO) in Africa encountered challenges in acquiring the appropriate parasite strains and establishing a viable challenge model within the project's designated timeline. Consequently, the experiment was relocated to the USA. Regrettably, the study was prematurely concluded without yielding results due to the onset of severe clinical symptoms in all test subjects, both vaccinated and unvaccinated.

Specific Objective 3: To test the dual acting babesiosis vaccine comprising antigens that show protective efficacy against geographically-distinct isolates of B. bovis.
$\square 4$ Fully met $\square 3$
$\square 2$
$\square 1$ Not met
Comment: The research team was unable to test a combination dual-acting vaccine due to delays in obtaining a suitable B. bovis isolate from Africa. The South African CRO contracted to conduct the trial in Africa could not source an African parasite line for the experiments or the challenge model. After discussions with the teams and IDRC's program officer, approval was given for the experiments to be conducted in the USDA laboratory with B. bovis strains from the US and Australia to provide proof of concept for the dual-acting vaccine. However, during the vaccine trial, all animals (vaccinated and unvaccinated) exhibited clinical signs that forced the team to stop the experiment. This last experiment coincided with the closure of the LVIF program.

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 

## 8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

The grant management capacity demonstrated by the research team met our expectations, and overall, the teams provided clear financial reports throughout the project. However, the team at USDA was unable to access their final payment because their institution closed the project's account before receiving the final payment from IDRC. The project principal investigator requested that another agreement be signed with IDRC to allow them to access the funds. Unfortunately, that request came after the closure of the LVIF initiative, under which the project was funded. We explained that it would not be possible because the LVIF program was already closed and that they should communicate with their institution's financial services to find a solution. Finally, the funds were returned to IDRC.

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

## 9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

The proposal was reviewed and considered strong, with a cutting-edge approach to developing a vaccine. The anticipated risks were those typical of vaccine development research, including the risk that the identified proteins as vaccine candidates might not elicit protective solid immunity. However, this risk was considered minor, especially given the expertise of the project teams. One risk that was not anticipated was the contract research organization (CRO), which contracted to conduct the vaccine trial in South Africa, failing to source a suitable parasite strain from Africa. The CRO failed to obtain the required authorization to import the parasite line from another lab (or country). Consequently, the experiment planned to be conducted in South Africa, using an African parasite and tick, was not performed.
10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

No ethic issues were encountered during this project.

# Program Leader comments 

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

This project was funded through the Livestock Vaccine Innovation Fund (LVIF), which was cofunded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), Global Affairs Canada (GAC) and IDRC. The fund was a 57\$ CAD partnership of 8 years. It ended in March 2024. LVIF adopted a strategic model that intervened at key entry points in the vaccine development, production, and access continuum. The Fund carried out research activities along three broad streams: cuttingedge vaccine development, vaccine improvement and manufacturing, and vaccine demand, access, and use. In the cutting-edge vaccine development stream, IDRC launched an open call for proposal that funded very upstream research projects. It was decided to fund a second phase of these successful projects, if they could demonstrate that they had reached proof of concept in the first phase. This process included a very rigorous review by IDRC staff as well as external reviewers from the private sector. The Fund supported eight projects through the initial discovery phase covering novel vaccine development for a range of livestock diseases (e.g. African Swine Fever, Avian Flu, and Foot and Mouth Disease), with several promising projects subsequently given Phase 2 funding to take the vaccines towards industry proof of concept. Grantees at this phase are primarily research institutes and universities. Overall, LVIF has thus far had mixed success and underperformed against its key long-term outcome targets, which were quite ambitious and therefore difficult to achieve. However, although there are only a few examples of newly validated vaccine candidates and market ready vaccines so far, there has been some progress towards proof of concept for the majority of phase 2 projects.

This specific project aimed to develop a dual-acting subunit vaccine against bovine babesiosis, focusing on both acute disease prevention and parasite transmission disruption. Despite significant research advancements, the project encountered challenges that prevented the final testing of the vaccine. Bovine babesiosis is a tick-borne disease that affects both animals and humans. Vaccines are usually live vaccines but have multiple drawbacks so easily deployable subunit vaccines are urgently needed to control these parasites. The research community has been trying to develop a nonlive vaccine for the last three decades; this demonstrates that the research team was up for a big challenge from the beginning.

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

A challenging project, with unfortunate setbacks preventing collaboration with African researchers and conduct of the trial in South Africa. Fortunately, however, there have been valuable, published findings and new knowledge generated that may contribute to a pathway to an effective vaccine.

A project that is led by researchers from USA and Australia, with little to no collaboration with those from LMICs is of course atypical for an IDRC initiative. It is not a highlight of the LVIF portfolio, but one among a portfolio of important projects where risks have been afforded in order to advance on solutions to neglected diseases among animals critical to food security and food system resilience.

As I have noted in other LVIF PCRs, despite the advancement of methodological capacity, new vaccine technologies and improved delivery systems, several of the LVIF projects highlighted the

--- Page 8 ---

challenges with marketability of vaccines and the weaknesses in African manufacturing of vaccines that limit the African countries' ability to ensure that the vaccines of most importance reach a majority of livestock farmers. It is therefore all the more apt that we have now been able to use surplus LVIF funding to support a project focused on strengthening vaccine technology transfer and manufacturing capacity (new project 110698). There remains important work to do as we consider future IDRC program priorities.

I look forward to our discussions and planning toward IDRC's contributions to animal production within a food systems resilience and lens.

I commend the LVIF team and approve this PCR.
