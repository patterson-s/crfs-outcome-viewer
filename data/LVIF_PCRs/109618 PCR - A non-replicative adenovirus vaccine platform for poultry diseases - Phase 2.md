# Project Abstract

--- Page 1 ---

Poultry farming in Africa is one of the biggest business opportunities on the continent. Chicken is the first choice of meat for most Africans, with a total of 5.7 million tonnes of chicken meat produced in Africa in 2018, an increase of $4.2 \%$ from 2017. Newcastle Disease (ND) is one of the most critical diseases affecting poultry production in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although reporting remains sporadic across the continent, some countries average 10 outbreaks per year which results in significant economic impact and deterioration in food security. Immunizations with inactivated or live vaccines are available and protective, but current vaccines available on the market have a number of well-known disadvantages, including virus shedding by vaccinated birds which can lead to disease in non-vaccinated poultry. Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) vaccines currently available are also produced in specific pathogen-free, embryonated chicken eggs. These eggs are expensive, and in Africa, supply is limited to importation from Europe. In addition, egg production methods are not efficient compared to cell culture technologies and are not adapted for rapid response in the case of emerging disease threats. Taking into consideration the economic burden of ND, the relative cost of the vaccine, and the current NDV production methods in Sub-Saharan Africa, a more cost-effective and efficient ND vaccine is needed. Such a vaccine has the potential to protect birds against NDV, as well as reduce the amount of virus shed by vaccinated birds to prevent transmission of virus within vaccinated flocks.

The first phase of this project was funded by the Livestock Vaccine Innovation Fund (LVIF) in 2017. The main objective was to develop a vaccine using a non-replicative human adenovirus vector expressing the F and HN antigens from NDV. Preliminary proof of concept studies showed positive results. The aim of the second phase was to establish the optimum dose and finalize the proof-of-concept study. This phase will also develop the manufacturing processes needed for a recombinant vaccine (produced using the HEK293 cell manufacturing platform) that is safer and more efficacious compared to the egg-based live ND vaccines currently produced at the National Veterinary Institute (NVI) in Ethiopia. The technology transfer of the cell culture and the adenovector platforms to NVI are expected to deliver cost-effective candidate veterinary vaccines against currently circulating ND viral strains. More importantly, the same technology platform, when implemented at NVI, has the potential to be rapidly deployed to respond to other avian viral threats.

# PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS 

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

- The research team has produced many different adenovirus-based vaccines expressing the F antigen from the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) at McGill University. Chicken experiments conducted at NVI in Ethiopia using the production lots showed protection from NDV challenge (lethal dose of $0.5 \times 106.5$ ELD50 homologous Debre zeit/2018 [MN909678] strain) can be achieved in $80-100 \%$ of the animals receiving mucosal vaccination doses (intranasal delivery) of purified or clarified adenoviral vector formulated at $1 \times 108,5 \times 108$, and $1 \times 109$ TCID50 per dose.
- The team has produced a final selection of liquid and solid formulations for the Ad-CMV-F adenoviral vector vaccine. Among the five liquid solutions produced, one optimal liquid formulation (Formulation L2) was identified through rigorous experimentation with various buffer compositions and excipients. The formulation was stable and maintained the Ad-CMV-F titer after 1 week at room temperature and for up to 24 weeks at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, with only

--- Page 2 ---

minor titer losses observed after 1 week at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. One (Solid formulation S1) of the 3 solid formulations (freeze drying) presented around $43 \%$ titer loss after 1 week at RT (below the $50 \%$ considered for acceptance). After storage at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 4 weeks, the 3 solid formulations were able to maintain the adenoviral titer unchanged after reconstitution and TCID50 assessments.

- The team at McGill University developed both Standard Operating Procedures and a regulatory guide document with requirements for the presentation of a dossier for a viral vector-based recombinant vaccine to the corresponding regulatory agency, which were prepared and transferred to NVI for registration on the vaccine in Ethiopia.
- Practical hands-on training at McGill University (June-July 2023) and at NVI (Nov-Dec 2023) were also organized. One of the project's NVI lead scientists participated in an intensive training period from June 5th to July 30th, 2023, to build capacity and master all the steps of the vaccine manufacturing process and quality control assessments. The objective of the training is to pave the way to an effective tech transfer.
- The main results obtained during the project were presented as an oral presentation at the Vaccine Conference VIII, Spain, in June 2022 and published in the Proceedings of the Conference International (ECI) Digital Archives. These results were published at their full extent in the Journal Vaccines as part of the Special Issue "Bioengineering in Vaccine Design and Delivery" (Vaccines 2024, 12, 41. https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines12010041).

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

--- Page 3 ---

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

This highly innovative project focused on developing a cost-effective Newcastle Disease (ND) vaccine for poultry farming in Africa makes a significant contribution to this sector by addressing a critical need for a cost-effective and safe Newcastle Disease (ND) vaccine for poultry farming in Africa. Through the innovative use of a non-replicating human adenovirus vector expressing the Fusion (F) and Hemagglutinin-Neuraminidase (HN) antigens of the ND virus, the project overcomes some limitations of current vaccines, such as the risk associated with excretion of the virus by vaccinated birds and reliance on expensive imported hen eggs for vaccine research. By leveraging cell culture technologies for vaccine production and facilitating technology transfer to the National Veterinary Institute (NVI) in Ethiopia, the project not only improves vaccine accessibility and scalability but also strengthens local vaccine development and manufacturing capabilities. Ultimately, the successful development of a cost-effective ND vaccine could potentially improve livestock health, enhance food security, and alleviate the economic burden associated with ND epidemics, thereby contributing to the resilience and sustainability of poultry farming in the region.
5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?
Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

The project was completed as planned.
6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.
Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

This project addresses all three of IDRC's 2020-2030 strategic objectives:
A) Invest in high-quality research and innovation in developing countries, enabling research organizations and their stakeholders in developing countries to address both their own and global challenges.

This project enabled research organizations and their stakeholders in developing countries to address both their own and global challenges. Newcastle disease is devastating for the chicken farming industry, particularly impacting small-holder farmers. Chickens are found in almost every household among livestock smallholders and are particularly economically important for women smallholders in LMICs. The project offered a strategic opportunity for LVIF to support the development of a cutting-edge, cost-effective, safer vaccine for diseases that greatly affect livestock production systems in LMIC regions.
B) Share knowledge for greater uptake and use, increasing the reach and impact of IDRCsupported research in driving solutions and influencing national, regional, and global development agendas, including through the synthesizing of results.

This project has the potential to increase the reach and impact of IDRC-supported research in driving solutions, influencing national, regional, and global development agendas, including through the synthesizing of results. For example, scientists working of the project have designed training for students, future scientists, technicians and stablished scientists including those from LMICs. One important objective of this proposal was the technology transfer from research institutions to a manufacturer. The technology transfer and training session in which LMICs research took part will allow the production of the vaccine at commercial levels to fulfill the market demands.

# C) Mobilize alliances for impact, growing international funding partnerships to expand available resources for research for development and developing enhanced relationships with the private sector to expand the reach of research. 

This project will enable IDRC to grow international funding partnerships to expand available resources for research development and develop enhanced relationships with the private sector to expand the reach of research. This project was supported through a partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Global Affairs Canada. The project supported researchers from Canada, Ethiopia and Tunisia to develop a new technology that has the potential to be of extreme importance for African vaccine manufacturers.
This project will also contribute directly to IDRC's climate-resilient food systems programming and will contribute knowledge toward the achievement of several Sustainable Development Goals. This project addresses three main SDGs by promoting and improving animal health and welfare to achieve highly sustainable production of the most important source of animal protein for Africa. The SDGs include: a) SDG 2 "End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture"; b) SDG 3 "Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages"; and c) SDG 12 "Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns".

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

This project was included in the evaluation conducted at the end of phase 1 to assess whether its objectives were met and whether it warranted further funding to proceed. The two-phase funding approach effectively prevented additional investment in projects that failed to deliver or struggled to meet their goals, thereby maximizing the chances of success by providing support where it was most needed.

The team has provided clear financial reports on a timely manner.

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

--- Page 6 ---

# 9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project? 

One of the anticipated risks in the implementation of this highly innovative project is that there is a probability that the results obtained from the various experiments may not respond to the hypothesis. However, that risk is present in all vaccine development research. The proposal came from a very experienced research team, which has successfully achieved all the proposed activities. Thus, that risk was deeded minor, especially since the team has already developed a well-established adenovirus vector platform technology to produce animal and human vaccines. In addition, the research team has provided tangible data that support the proposed hypotheses and has satisfied the LVIF ERP that the proposed experimental design meets the required threshold (to the extent of current knowledge in this field) of this vector vaccine with the capacity for protection.

Another anticipated risk was related to the delay in starting the project because of the COVID-19 pandemic. To minimize that risk, a buffer time has been built into the project. Despite that, the institutions involved in the project have experienced delays due to the pandemic. To mitigate delay, the LVIF team in consultation with the BMGF and GAC granted an 18-month extension to all projects indoor the allow them to cope with the lab closures or the slowing of research activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

One unanticipated risk was the challenge of swiftly establishing the necessary local capacity for the project in Ethiopia. The team encountered prolonged delays in procuring crucial infrastructure for technology transfer and fully mastering the operation of new equipment for manufacturing the adenoviral vector. Some planned equipment purchases ultimately fell through by the project's end. Furthermore, a scientist from NVI, who had been trained at McGill University in the manufacturing process, departed NVI midway through the project. This necessitated that the LVIF and McGill teams organize additional training, a task made difficult by visa processing times.

## 10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

There are no research ethic issues encountered during this project.

## Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

This project was funded through the Livestock Vaccine Innovation Fund (LVIF), which was cofunded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), Global Affairs Canada (GAC) and IDRC. The fund was a 57\$ CAD partnership of 8 years. It ended in March 2024. LVIF adopted a strategic model that intervened at key entry points in the vaccine development, production, and access continuum. The Fund carried out research activities along three broad streams: cuttingedge vaccine development, vaccine improvement and manufacturing, and vaccine demand, access, and use. In the cutting-edge vaccine development stream, IDRC launched an open call for proposal that funded very upstream research projects. It was decided to fund a second phase of these successful projects, if they could demonstrate that they had reached proof of concept in the first phase. This process included a very rigorous review by IDRC staff as well as external reviewers from the private sector. The Fund supported eight projects through the initial discovery phase covering novel vaccine development for a range of livestock diseases (e.g. African Swine Fever, Avian Flu, and Foot and Mouth Disease), with several promising projects subsequently

# PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

**IDRC CRDI**

Given Phase 2 funding to take the vaccines towards industry proof of concept. Grantees at this phase are primarily research institutes and universities. Overall, LVIF has thus far had mixed success and underperformed against its key long-term outcome targets, which were quite ambitious and therefore difficult to achieve. However, although there are only a few examples of newly validated vaccine candidates and market ready vaccines so far, there has been some progress towards proof of concept for the majority of phase 2 projects.

This specific LVIF project aimed to address the economic burden of Newcastle Disease in Sub-Saharan Africa by developing a cost-effective and efficient vaccine using a non-replicative human adenovirus vector. Phase I focused on developing the vaccine, while Phase II aimed to optimize the dose, finalize proof-of-concept, and develop manufacturing processes for a recombinant vaccine. This research project was highly successful, and its key outcomes include successful vaccine trials, development of liquid and solid formulations, regulatory documents, and training sessions for local scientists. The project contributed to the field by addressing the need for a safe and cost-effective Newcastle Disease vaccine, improving local vaccine development capabilities, and supporting food security and economic stability in Africa.

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

A fascinating and successful second-phase project. While acknowledging the challenges noted above in relation to LVIF achievements toward manufacturing and marketability of livestock vaccines, this project was impressive in its achievement of its objectives including proof of concept and the building of capacities within Ethiopia and Tunisia. It would be good to continue learning about the priorities and ambitions of these countries to advance toward local manufacturing and scaling up use, and the extent of local commitment to financing.

Even though this project was very technology focused, the team has done well to communicate its value addition and outcomes in simpler terms via public communications.

Despite the advancement of methodological capacity, new vaccine technologies and improved delivery systems, several of the LVIF projects highlighted the challenges with marketability of vaccines and the weaknesses in African manufacturing of vaccines that limit the African countries' ability to ensure that the vaccines of most importance reach a majority of livestock farmers. It is therefore all the more apt that we have now been able to use surplus LVIF funding to support a project focused on strengthening vaccine technology transfer and manufacturing capacity (new project 110698). There remains important work to do as we consider future IDRC program priorities.

I look forward to our discussions and planning toward IDRC's contributions to animal production within a food systems resilience and lens.

I commend the LVIF team and approve this PCR.
