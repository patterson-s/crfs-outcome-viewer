Project Abstract
The DeLiVa project focused on achieving institutional change to improve the delivery of livestock vaccines to pastoralist communities in Ethiopia. The institutional changes required were at two levels. First, a shift was needed within government to enable the private sector to implement livestock vaccination programs at cost/profit to livestock keepers to improve vaccine delivery timeliness, coverage and sustainability. Second, changes at community level were needed to recognize that improved vaccination services were possible but at a cost to them. The approach used by the project was to design and deliver a public-private partnership (PPP) model for contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP) vaccine. Ultimately, the project aimed to enhance livelihoods and food security in pastoralist communities who are heavily reliant on livestock for their food, income and social capital. The project design included specific elements to understand and improve the involvement of women in livestock vaccination. The DeLiVa project was implemented in Borena Zone, southern Ethiopia from June 2021 to November 2023. To support the PPP model the project assisted the National Veterinary Institute in Ethiopia to improve CCPP vaccine production in terms of quality and quantity and also ensure that CCPP vaccine was certified by the African Union's Pan African Veterinary Vaccine Centre (PANVAC).
The PPP model was based on clear roles and responsibilities of public and private sector partners along a chain from initial vaccine production to vaccine delivery and monitoring at community level. The model involved a single franchise, Abyssinia AgroVet Import and Distribution plc. and four franchisees, and a business plan for these partners. The franchisees worked with community-based animal health workers (CAHWs) to deliver the vaccine. Throughout the vaccine delivery system, rigorous cold chain management was used. The project engaged extensively with government actors, from federal to local levels, to discuss and raise awareness of the PPP model and secure government buy-in. This was supported by communication and awareness-raising activities with communities, and a willingness-to-pay study.

# PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

--- Page 1 ---

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?
$\checkmark$ National vaccine institute (NVI) have manufactured more than 1 million doses of PANVAC-certified CCPP vaccine.
$\checkmark$ A first round of CCPP vaccination program was conducted, targeting 333,000 goats in four woredas (districts), with vaccine delivery by private veterinarians and animal health assistants (franchisees) and CAHWs. Average vaccination coverage by animal by $89.3 \%$.
$\checkmark$ The vaccination program reached 16,634 households, of which on average $28.1 \%$ were female-headed households.
$\checkmark$ A project baseline assessment reported that the government operational budget for veterinary services for the four woredas in 2022 was 535,000 birr. In contrast, the income received by the four franchisees between July and November 2023 was 2,677,491 birr, or approximately five times the government's annual operational budget for 2022. As this income was for a single disease prevention measure in a single species i.e. CCPP vaccine for goats, this result shows an important part of the economic rationale for private sector involvement in vaccine delivery, and the willingness of pastoralists to pay for the service.
$\checkmark$ The project raised awareness and importance of CCPP vaccination among pastoralists and community leaders through extensive sensitization activities, reaching over 2,700 individuals, with $95 \%$ reporting awareness of the vaccination value chain. Critically, in terms of disease control the project showed that vaccination could be a preventive measure to be applied at scale or area-wide using a PPP model.

# RESEARCH OUTPUTS 

2. List up to 10 most important research outputs generated by the project. Where possible, provide the link.
Outputs are the directly achievable products of a project's completed activities (e.g. policy briefs, journal articles, research papers, trained people, etc.). Indicate the project outputs that were published on an open access basis. What, if any, outputs resulting from this project will be published open access beyond the duration of the project, and it is possible that the grantee will seek further IDRC support for this?

## a) Community based Animal Health Workers Refresher Training:

Community animal health workers (CAHWs) are community members who have been trained to provide basic animal health care services to livestock owners in pastoral areas. They were typically recruited from the local community and receive training on animal health, disease prevention, and treatment. CAHWs play a vital role in improving animal health and productivity in pastoral areas, and they also help to reduce the risk of zoonotic diseases. CAHWs also work to raise awareness of animal health issues and to promote good animal husbandry practices. They often work closely with other community members, such as traditional healers, to ensure that livestock owners have access to the best possible care. CAHWs can play a vital role in providing livestock vaccinations in pastoral areas. They are often the first point of contact for livestock owners, and they are able to provide vaccinations in a timely and efficient manner.
The project organized refresher trainings for CAHWs in all four districts to equip them with appropriate knowledge to use CCPP vaccine and work according to the PPP model. A total of 106 CAHWs ( 27 from Elwaye, 30 from Yabello, 32 from Dubuluk and 17 from Moyale) received refresher training and showed their technical capabilities to participate in the CCPP vaccination campaign under the franchisees.

## b) Training held at NVI in November 2022

The training objectives were: $\cdot$ To strengthen knowledge and skills in the domain of animal health services delivery, safe handling and use of veterinary drugs, vaccine and vaccine delivery and other soft skills. - To provide trainers the knowledge, skills and tools needed to effectively integrate gender equality and social inclusion considerations and strengthen gender integrated livestock vaccine delivery project implementation, in

--- Page 2 ---

particular the CCPP vaccine value chain. - To build woreda animal health service capacity to identify epidemiologically important areas to be targeted for vaccine delivery and control.
A total of 30 participants attended the workshop, including government veterinarians, Animal Health Assistants, private veterinary practitioners, and regional veterinary laboratory staff. The participants were evaluated at the end of the training course. The evaluation results showed that the participants had a good understanding of the training content and were able to apply the skills they learned in the practical exercises.

To overcome the implementation challenges posed by the project, including project approval delays due to the COVD-19 pandemic, delayed release of project funds, conflicts of interest among public and private professionals, reluctance among pastoralists and kebele administrators, lack of coordination at the local level, and transitioning from a free government vaccination program to a franchise model, the project made the following adjustments:

- $\quad$ Clarified payment mechanisms between different local actors,
- $\quad$ Conducted conflict resolution sessions among public and private professionals involved in the project,
- $\quad$ Engaged in extensive awareness campaigns.

Despite challenges, the PPP franchising model for livestock vaccine delivery using CCPP vaccine made substantial progress, providing evidence for policy and institutional changes supporting private sector vaccine delivery in Ethiopia and potentially influencing broader policy frameworks.

# PROJECT OUTCOMES 

## 4. How does the project contribute to the field of study/research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?
Rural communities in Ethiopia are highly dependent on livestock production for their livelihoods. Livestock provide products such as milk for home consumption and sale, and they are an important and flexible form of financial savings. A major constraint to small ruminant production is the severe impacts of diseases that reduces the production of goats through morbidity, mortality and market restriction. Disease prevention is hindered by low vaccination coverage. Vaccine delivery systems have relied almost exclusively on government veterinary services, which provide vaccines at no charge or are highly subsidized. The government system is constrained by low budgets, limited manpower and poor-quality reporting systems. Given this situation there was a need to develop alternative vaccine delivery approaches in rural Ethiopia. This was especially the case in pastoralist areas where livelihoods depend on livestock, but where veterinary services were particularly weak.
The project has successfully designed and tested an alternative, private sector model of CCPP vaccine delivery that has improved availability, accessibility, and demand for CCPP vaccine and other veterinary products in pastoral communities. The project has generated new knowledge about the factors that influence the uptake of CCPP vaccine by pastoralists, the role of women in CCPP vaccine delivery, and the potential for private sector delivery of CCPP vaccine. The project has made a significant contribution to knowledge from a scientific, developmental, and policy perspective. From a scientific perspective, the project has generated new knowledge about the factors that influence the uptake of CCPP vaccine by pastoralists, the role of women in CCPP vaccine delivery, and the potential for private sector delivery of CCPP vaccine. This knowledge will be useful for future research on CCPP vaccine delivery and for the development of policies to improve the delivery of CCPP vaccine and other veterinary products in pastoral communities. The project has shown that by working with private sector actors, it is possible to increase the availability, accessibility, and demand for CCPP vaccine and other veterinary products in pastoral communities. This has led to significant improvements in the livelihoods of women and children in these communities.
From a policy perspective, the project has identified a number of key policy interventions that could be used to promote PPP for the delivery of CCPP vaccine and other veterinary products in Ethiopia. These interventions include providing financial incentives to private sector actors, strengthening the capacity of local veterinary service delivery agents, and improving the regulatory environment for the delivery of veterinary products. These interventions could help to improve the delivery of CCPP vaccine and other veterinary products in pastoral communities and lead to further improvements in livelihoods.
Despite numerous challenges encountered during the project, the PPP franchising model for livestock vaccine delivery using CCPP vaccine made substantial progress, providing evidence for policy and institutional changes supporting private sector vaccine delivery in Ethiopia and potentially influencing broader policy frameworks.

# PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

**IDRC CRDI**

*Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?*

The project encountered several challenges, necessitating significant alterations to the activities.

## Operational challenges:

In November 2020 to 2021, civil conflict erupted in northern Ethiopia's Tigray region which quickly escalated into a major humanitarian and political crisis. Although initially focused in Tigray, the conflict led to political instability and armed conflict in other regions of Ethiopia, as well as a general rise in criminality and insecurity. These events led to a need to remove Tigray as a study site in the original project proposal and re-work project documents and budgets, which in turn contributed to delayed project start-up. Logistically, the project locations in southern Ethiopia were not directly affected by the conflict. However, the most direct travel routes to project locations became unsafe, meaning that more circuitous travel was needed to reach project locations.

In 2022, a very severe drought affected southern Ethiopia, including the project locations. The European Commission reported that 8.1 million people were affected and that, "The drought is causing water scarcity, food insecurity, a severe disruption to livelihoods. It is resulting in rising food prices, increasing malnutrition rates amongst children, and displacement of people searching for food and pastures. If not addressed, the drought may lead to famine-like conditions." Livestock deaths were reported at 1.5 million animals. This situation led to difficulties with planning the project's vaccination program and related activities and raised questions over when a PPP model with payment for services might be appropriate. During a drought it is not possible to accurately predict when the drought will end.

The events above reflect the operational realities of research in the Horn of Africa and show the need to flexibility and adaptive management. While at the technical level the project has been reshaped or relocated to achieve similar objectives, these changes have required adaptive and timely administrative support.

## Administrative challenges:

The original project agreement ran for an 18-month period from January 2021 to September 2022 and the agreement specified a Work Completion Date of 1st July 2022. However, due to delays in project start-up, the actual implementation started on 1st May 2021. This delay arose due to a delay in signing the original project agreement (it was not signed until the end of February 2021), the transfer of the project from one school at Tufts to another, hiring and onboarding of personnel, and a prolonged administrative review of the project agreement by Tufts senior decision makers. With the start date of 1st May 2021, a 30-month period of implementation was suggested to ensure two rounds of CCPP vaccination and provide sufficient time for a technical evaluation. However, the project's late start was compounded by requests for a 4-month no-cost extension, supplemental budget request and a 12-month extension with related extension budget. These requests coincided with the onset of the major civil conflict in the north of Ethiopia and state of emergency which delayed approval of the revised project timeframe and budget within IDRC. Further delays then occurred with Tufts University on receipt of the revised agreement from IDRC. These delays were associated with a shift in the project from the nutrition school to the veterinary school at Tufts, and internal concerns about currency exchange rate issues. Tufts had not signed the revised agreement by the end of Year 1 (December 2021), with the effect that all subcontracts to partners in Ethiopia were still pending at that point. The initial 4-month delay in implementing the project necessitated a no-cost extension. The delay in the approval of supplemental funding and cost extension severely hampered the project implementation. It affected the plan to run vaccination in January 2022 and be completed by mid-February 2022 as part of the risk-based approach. Consequently, the project was forced to look for another vaccination window in September to October 2022, as outbreaks of CCPP were anticipated following the short rainy season (October - December 2022).

## 6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

*Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.*

*Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy.*

Provide specific numbers where possible.
Contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP) is a severe respiratory disease of goats and wild ruminants that has a significant economic impact on livestock production in fragile rural economies, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.
The DeLiVa project has made commendable progress, achieving its objectives in improving livelihoods, food security, and empowering women and children through livestock vaccine delivery. Successful establishment of PANVAC-certified CCPP vaccine production capabilities by the National Veterinary Institute (NVI) demonstrates effective project support.

# 1- Innovative Public-Private Partnership Model: 

The project's design of a cost-effective and sustainable public-private partnership (PPP) CCPP vaccine delivery franchise model is innovative and demonstrates potential for replication in other regions and countries.

## 2- Stakeholder Engagement and Awareness:

The project effectively engaged key stakeholders, including the Ministry of Agriculture, regional, zonal and woreda agriculture offices, facilitating consent and support for project activities. Extensive awareness campaigns significantly increased pastoralists' awareness of CCPP vaccination, enhancing access to vaccines.

## 3- Research and data-driven decision making:

The project's commitment to studies and research during the pilot phase provides valuable insights, guiding the refinement of the CCPP vaccine delivery model and addressing constraints in public veterinary services.

## 4- Gender inclusivity:

In Ethiopia, there is a knowledge gap regarding the role of women in livestock vaccine delivery chains. This includes poor understanding of the social, economic, and institutional factors that influence women's ability to participate in livestock vaccine value chains and benefit from them. This project has achieved an interesting gender analysis study, which highlights the importance of women in the livestock value chain and recommends their active involvement in the vaccine value chain and veterinary health care.

## FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

**8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?**

- The research team's grant management capacity met our expectations, and the team provided clear financial reports throughout the project. However, the team encountered numerous administrative challenges, that delayed the agreement signature as detailed in section 5.
- The final financial analysis indicates that the Trustees of Tufts University have a cash balance of 153,164 USD. A refund of 153,164 USD was requested, which was subsequently transferred to IDRC.
- One activity was not achieved while the project was being terminated. The team committed to delivering the result upon project completion. However, while PO sent numerous emails requesting updates, PI, the responsible party for the activity, ceased responding to IDRC emails, which could be perceived as unprofessional.

# Program Leader comments 

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

## Program Leader

This project was funded through the Livestock Vaccine Innovation Fund (LVIF), which was cofunded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), Global Affairs Canada (GAC) and IDRC. The fund was a 57\$ CAD partnership of 8 years. It ended in March 2024. LVIF adopted a strategic model that intervened at key entry points in the vaccine development, production, and access continuum. The Fund carried out research activities along three broad streams: cuttingedge vaccine development, vaccine improvement and manufacturing, and vaccine demand, access, and use. In the vaccine demand, access and use stream, IDRC launched a closed call for proposal that funded research projects that focused on scale and delivery scale projects. A total of 2 projects were funded in this closed call. One in Madagascar and this one based in Ethiopia. Grantees in this stream of research were a mix of academics, government and private institutions.
This specific project aimed at improving livestock vaccine delivery in pastoral areas of Ethiopia through a public-private partnership (PPP) model. The project, which ran from June 2021 to November 2023, sought to enhance food security and livelihoods by increasing access to vaccines against livestock diseases. More specifically, the project focused on institutional changes to enable private sector involvement in livestock vaccination, aiming to improve delivery timeliness, coverage, and sustainability. The project key achievement was that Over 1 million doses of PANVAC-certified CCPP vaccine were produced, with a vaccination program reaching 333,000 goats and achieving an average coverage of $89.3 \%$. And most importantly, the income generated by franchisees significantly exceeded the government's operational budget for veterinary services, demonstrating the economic viability of private sector involvement in vaccine delivery. In conclusion, the project identified key policy interventions to promote PPPs for vaccine delivery, contributing to knowledge about the role of women in livestock health and potential improvements in veterinary services. This project was able to obtain great results even though they were faced with multiple challenges.
