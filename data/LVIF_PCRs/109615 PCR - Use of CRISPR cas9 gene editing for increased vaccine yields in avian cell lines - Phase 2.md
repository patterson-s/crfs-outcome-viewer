Project Abstract

--- Page 1 ---

Poultry diseases cause devastating economic losses for small-scale livestock farmers globally. Despite clear limitations, embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) remain the main platform for poultry vaccine production worldwide. These eggs are generally expensive and mostly imported, thus limiting smallholder livestock farmers' access to vaccines due to high vaccine pricing. Equally important are the ethical considerations of using ECE and the significant amount of egg waste that is produced - a critical cost issue, especially for low and middle-income countries). In addition, ECE supply, especially during avian viral pandemics, becomes restricted, which reduces the ability to respond to any emerging threat.

Improved cell culture-based vaccine production is now a significant alternative for the poultry vaccine industry in general. The objective of this project is to improve viral yields for cell-based poultry vaccine production. This will be achieved by the removal of the Interferon-Inducible Transmembrane (IFITM) mediated viral entry barrier in avian cells. Type level I interferons are proteins that protect cells from virus infection by switching on specific anti-viral genes, which inhibit the replication of several highly pathogenic animal and human viruses, including Ebola, Influenza, and HIV-1. The Pirbright Institute has shown that a reduction in the level of IFITM in chicken cells infected with influenza produces more viruses than normal cells.

In 2017, the Livestock Vaccine Innovation Fund (LVIF) supported the first phase of this project aimed at generating IFITM-deficient cells using gene editing techniques to remove the IFITM genes. Preliminary proof of concept studies showed positive results and the potential to move this technology toward a vaccine manufacturing environment. In this second phase, the team will advance the research toward a final modified cell line prototype that can attract further industry development and commercialization. This novel technology could significantly reduce vaccine production costs, especially in low and middle-income countries, where expensive embryonated eggs are imported for vaccine production. Further, avian-origin cell lines edited in this way have an added advantage over mammalian cell lines in better supporting the growth of avian viruses, including egg-adapted strains. This technology has the potential for application in many other existing vaccine production systems, thus enhancing vaccine availability for a wide range of livestock diseases important for smallholders in developing countries.

# PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS 

## 1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

In phase 1 of this project, the research team demonstrated that using CRISPR/Cas9 deleted the entire IFITM locus from the immortalized chicken fibroblast cell line DF1 was associated with higher infectivity, expression of the immunogenic domain, and viral yield of avian influenza and Newcastle disease viruses. The main objective of phase 2 was to test the cell editing technology under industrial conditions and identify commercial or new cell lines that could benefit from this innovative technology.

- The project team cooperated with Fivevet (Vietnam), Vaccine Valley (Egypt), and Deltamune (South Africa) to evaluate vaccine virus growth in edited cells under commercial conditions. At Fivevet, edited DF1 cells exhibited significantly higher viable virus titers for Newcastle disease virus (NDV) genotype VII compared to non-edited cells, with a 1 to 1.2

--- Page 2 ---

log10 increase and approximately ten-fold higher yields than those from embryonated chicken eggs (ECE). Similarly, at Vaccine Valley, edited DF1 cells yielded 1.5 to 2 log10 higher NDV viral titers compared to non-edited cells, surpassing ECE yields by 1 to 2.5 $\log 10$ TCID50. Deltamune's assessment further confirmed these findings, with a sevenfold increase in NDV La Sota yields with IFITM knockout clone 250 compared to wild-type DF1 cells. Although edited QM5 cells showed higher sensitivity to infection, both edited and non-edited cells proved ineffective for Pox virus growth, and Reovirus titers in QM5 cells were low for vaccine production, regardless of IFITM knockout status.

- The team also investigated whether removing immune pressure alters virus immunogenicity and replication efficiency. Results showed no significant differences in antigenicity or virus titer after passage in edited and non-edited cells. However, H9N2 virus ceased inducing plaques after passage 15 despite maintaining the same HA titer. Whole genome sequencing revealed no mutation in antigenic domains of viruses, but there was a mutation that was previously shown to be linked to adaptations specific to cell culture, aligning with data from Fivevet and Vaccine Valley that showed no change in the antigenicity of their viruses upon passage in edited DF1 cells.
- Assessment of the potential impact of IFITM knockout on cell stability via karyotyping over passaging showed that clonal variability had a stronger correlation with karyotype stability and chromosome aberrations than CRISPR/Cas9 editing.
- Knockout of the whole IFITM locus in cell lines of interest to vaccine producers, such as QM5 cells from Deltamune and chicken lung epithelial cell (CLEC213) lines, increased virus infectivity and expression of immunogenic domains but not viable viral yield.
- RNA-seq analysis on IFITM knockout DF1 cells and LMH cells before and after influenza and NDV infection revealed significant upregulation of genes correlated with the cellular membrane and plasma membrane signal transduction, and edited cells showed a more pronounced response to infection compared to non-edited cells. However, differences between edited DF1 cells and parental WT or single-cell clone cells made it difficult to conclude the true impact of knockout, leading to a prioritization of enhancing technology utility for vaccine producers over real-time PCR validation of RNA seq experiments.
- The outstanding NDV genotype VII viral yield in edited DF1 cells compared to other viruses' infections necessitates understanding the underlying cellular response of edited DF1 cells to infection at three different time points. The results were analyzed using the sequencing company's platform, which showed clear differences, but the method of analysis was not straightforward. Thus, the team decided to validate the results with the Pirbright Institute bioinformatician.
- The team established intensified culture protocols for the edited DF1 cells to facilitate largescale production. They tested several intensification strategies and successfully cultured edited DF1 cells in microcarriers and roller bottles using reduced serum media, achieving growth rates higher than those of well-established mammalian cell lines such as Vero cells. The culture conditions were sent to Fivevet to grow DF1 cells on a large scale and produce NDV genotype VII at an industrial scale to assess whether the high NDV growth rate is maintained.

- Importantly, the team developed tools in the current project, such as DF1 single-cell clones with single IFITMs KO and DF1 cells stably expressing flag-tagged single IFITMs. Furthermore, the tools and methods developed in the current project allowed to explore the antiviral roles, locations, and interactions of each of the quail IFITMs with viruses, which was the first time to be described. All these materials and methods will be made available for the research community for further investigation into the roles and interactions of IFITMs.

# PROJECT OUTCOMES 

## 4. How does the project contribute to the field of study/research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

Avian viruses continue to pose significant challenges to the poultry industry, leading to reduced productivity and increased mortality. The development of effective and affordable vaccines is an ongoing effort against new viral strains, which holds the promise of enhancing food security in low to middle-income countries where these diseases are prevalent. The slow growth of viruses and the dependence on embryonated eggs (ECE) for vaccine development and production present considerable obstacles, contributing to higher costs and longer production times. Moreover, the ECE-based viral vaccine production system faces numerous region-specific challenges, such as supply issues, costs, contamination risks, and the generation of biological waste. Consequently, there is a need for a more cost-effective, rapid, and sustainable viral vaccine production system.

During the project's phase 1, the research team discovered that knocking out the IFITMs locus in embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs) increased the infectivity of the cells and viral yields. Experiments using IFITMs KO DF1 cell lines (edited cells) resulted in greater viral growth compared to non-edited cells or ECEs. In the project's second phase, the team examined the edited cells' potential under commercial conditions and investigated other cell lines that could benefit from gene editing technology. Collaborations with industrial partners, including Fivevet (Vietnam), Deltamune (South Africa), and Vaccine Valley (Egypt), allowed the testing and validation of these findings in a commercial setting.

Enhancing the yield from such cell lines offers the immediate commercial advantage of producing larger quantities at the same cost, making cells with advantageous traits commercially viable.

In summary, the IDRC's funding of this project has proven to be a wise investment. It has furthered the understanding of gene editing technology to boost vaccine production and laid the groundwork for more sustainable vaccine production methods in low-to middle-income countries (LMICs).

## A) Invest in high-quality research and innovation in developing countries, enabling research organizations and their stakeholders in developing countries to address both their own and global challenges.

Poultry diseases are economically devastating for the chicken farming industry in Africa and Asia. Chickens are found in almost every household among smallholder livestock farming communities and are particularly important for women smallholders. The project offers a strategic opportunity

--- Page 5 ---

for LVIF to support the improvement of poultry vaccine production for diseases that affect backyard poultry production systems in low and middle-income countries (LMICs).
B) Share knowledge for greater uptake and use, increasing the reach and impact of IDRCsupported research in driving solutions and influencing national, regional, and global development agendas, including through the synthesizing of results.

In phase 1, the project provided strong training to two postdoctoral scientists, Dr. Andreas Alber and Dr. Ahmed Ibrahim. Phase 2 allowed Dr. Ahmed Ibrahim to continue strengthening his research skills while acquiring experience in project management and building working partnerships with international private research organizations. Additionally, the project transferred its new viral vaccine production system to LMICs, including Deltamune (RSA), Fivevet Central Veterinary Medicine JSC (Vietnam), and Vaccine Valley (Egypt). This transfer of technology to vaccine manufacturers in LMICs will have a more significant impact in regions where poultry diseases are endemic and affect smallholder livestock farmers.
C) Mobilize alliances for impact, growing international funding partnerships to expand available resources for research for development and developing enhanced relationships with the private sector to expand the reach of research.

This project was funded through a partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Global Affairs Canada. It supports a team of public and private sector organizations in developing and optimizing a vaccine production technology that has the potential to be of extreme economic importance for poultry vaccine manufacturers in LMICs.

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

The team has proven strong grant management capacities and have submitted clear financial reports throughout the project duration.

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

The main risk anticipated for this cutting-edge research initiative was the likelihood of the technology and the resulting vaccine being more expensive than vaccine production via standard ECE methods after process development. The research team, in consultation with the IDRC team, examined the different options, such as which cell line to test, to ensure the development of a less expensive vaccine, which has now been accomplished.

Another anticipated risk was related to the inability to find others that could be modified for commercial purposes. Finding a cell line with rights for commercialization capable of supporting avian viral replication at commercial production levels and whose main mechanism of protection against viruses is IFN inhibition is important for the successful use of the technology. Results obtained indicated that culturing avian viruses such as the Influenza virus and Newcastle disease virus on the edited widely accessible DF1 cell line increased viral yield without promising antigenicity, resulting in the virus even after several passages.
10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

The project did not encounter any ethic-related issues.

## Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

This project was funded through the Livestock Vaccine Innovation Fund (LVIF), which was cofunded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), Global Affairs Canada (GAC) and IDRC. The fund was a 57\$ CAD partnership of 8 years. It ended in March 2024. LVIF adopted a strategic model that intervened at key entry points in the vaccine development, production, and access continuum. The Fund carried out research activities along three broad streams: cuttingedge vaccine development, vaccine improvement and manufacturing, and vaccine demand, access, and use. In the cutting-edge vaccine development stream, IDRC launched an open call for proposal that funded very upstream research projects. It was decided to fund a second phase of these successful projects, if they could demonstrate that they had reached proof of concept in the first phase. This process included a very rigorous review by IDRC staff as well as external reviewers from the private sector. The Fund supported eight projects through the initial discovery phase covering novel vaccine development for a range of livestock diseases (e.g. African Swine Fever, Avian Flu, and Foot and Mouth Disease), with several promising projects subsequently given Phase 2 funding to take the vaccines towards industry proof of concept. Grantees at this phase are primarily research institutes and universities. Overall, LVIF has thus far had mixed success and underperformed against its key long-term outcome targets, which were quite ambitious and therefore difficult to achieve. However, although there are only a few examples of newly validated vaccine candidates and market ready vaccines so far, there has been some progress towards proof of concept for the majority of phase 2 projects. This specific project focused on improving viral yields for cell-based poultry vaccine production by removing the IFITM-mediated viral entry barrier in avian cells. It specifically targeted poultry diseases such as avian influenza and Newcastle disease which are highly important diseases. It also had the objective of moving away from vaccine production that relies on virus grown in chicken eggs and rely on cell-based culture. This would allow for a faster vaccine production in some manufacturing facilities. Phase 1 of this project demonstrated that CRISPR/Cas9 deletion of the IFITM locus in chicken fibroblast cell line DF1 increased viral yields for avian influenza and Newcastle disease viruses. Phase 2 aimed to test the cell editing technology under industrial conditions and identify commercial cell lines. Collaborations with vaccine producers in Vietnam, Egypt, and South Africa showed significantly higher viral yields in edited cells compared to non-edited cells and embryonated chicken eggs. The project has advanced the understanding of gene editing technology for vaccine production, providing a more sustainable method for producing vaccines in low and middle-income countries.

# Director comments 

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

It's fascinating to read this very technologically focused project that has involved successful international collaborations, capacity development and discoveries that can allow for efficient, sustainable production of vaccines, in Africa, for the prevention of diseases in the most accessible and commonly eaten food animals. Combined with other LVIF investments, there have been valuable advances that are worth keeping current in our minds as we plan for future contributions by IDRC.

Despite the advancement of methodological capacity, new vaccine technologies and improved delivery systems, several of the LVIF projects highlighted the challenges with marketability of vaccines and the weaknesses in African manufacturing of vaccines that limit the African countries' ability to ensure that the vaccines of most importance reach a majority of livestock farmers. It is therefore all the more apt that we have now been able to use surplus LVIF funding to support a project focused on strengthening vaccine technology transfer and manufacturing capacity (new project 110698). There remains important work to do as we consider future IDRC program priorities.

I look forward to our discussions and planning toward IDRC's contributions to animal production within a food systems resilience and lens.
