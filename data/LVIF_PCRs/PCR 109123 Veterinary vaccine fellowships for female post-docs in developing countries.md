# Project Highlights 

What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

The project allowed the International Veterinary Vaccinology Network (IVVN) to develop a fellowship programme and award fellowship funding to six women post-doctoral researchers from low-and-middle income countries (LMICs).

This project was important to fund as women researchers from LMICs continue to face big gaps in early and mid-career science positions and lack the mentorship opportunities to get there. In the 2018 IVVN member survey, nearly half of the women from LMICs who participated listed a lack of mentoring opportunities as one of their greatest professional challenges. In contrast, not a single male respondent from a high-income country reported this to be a challenge. The underrepresentation of women from LMICs in scientific research, especially in senior academic positions, is a consequence of unevenly distributed opportunities for career advancement. In turn, this results in a lack of gender parity and LMIC representation on boards, expert review panels and other forums that influence and shape entire fields of research. These findings motivated the IVVN to partner with the LVIF program to develop a mentoring fellowship programme specifically for female researchers in LMICs. This project was developed through a series of meetings with the IVVN at the sidelines of an April 2019 LVIF workshop in London UK. In these meetings, the IVVN highlighted its work on women's capacity strengthening and empowerment in veterinary vaccinology research in Africa. The IVVN has dedicated CAD \$250,000 to this initiative for three fellows and reached out to LVIF to co-fund the program for the same amount for an additional three fellows, bringing the total to six fellowships awarded in 2021 to researchers from Brazil, Egypt, Kenya, India and South Africa. Each fellow received up to $£ 50,000$ to cover their research costs, travel and salary, allowing them to work with a local and international mentor on a eleven-month project to advance the development of veterinary vaccines.

As part of the project, fellows were paired with both local and international mentors, who provided support and mentorship. Fellowships enabled female post-doctoral researchers (mentees) to work with both a local mentor within their current research organisation and an international mentor based in the UK or other institutes outside the Mentee's country. The importance of this was mentioned previously, as well as by the fellows themselves:
"Dr Ruth and Dr Tatiana were wonderful mentors in the fellowship, they supported me in the challenging moments we've faced in the past year and always provided guidance to overcome the hurdles and to ensure we would achieve our goals. Besides, they always encouraged me and provided opportunities for me to thrive in my career, standing out as perfect role models and great examples of how women should support women in science. Overall, the collaboration established between Dr Tatiana, Dr Ruth, and I was a very fruitful and successful, and we plan to pursue other scientific endeavors together." (From Fellow, Laura Oliveira, Final Report)
"While the majority of this fellowship was virtual between the mentors, this created a space to build around interactive discussions, guided reflection, and collaboration. Being a part of poultry vaccine professionals was invaluable and the mentors have been a great sounding board for finding my direction, validating purpose statements, and testing hypotheses...This Mentee-Mentor relationship has also led to growth in different areas such as networking to engage social and professional support, growth in confidence with respect to connecting with stakeholders in the poultry value chain and

managing the work environment such as prioritizing work that was most fruitful to advancing research and career objectives within the time line provided" (From Fellow, Angela Makumi, Final Report)

A small network of women scientists was created, allowing the fellows to meet and exchange experiences.

In late 2020, based on positive experiences with holding community of practice and annual learning meetings with the LVIF women's empowerment cohort of projects, the Responsible Officer recommended to IVVN to consider holding a series of learning/sharing events to bring all the fellows together. The idea was that the shared mentee experience could be useful as extra support, allow them to check-in on their experience as women in science, further build their scientific networks, and provide feedback to IVVN on the fellowship program. IVVN had not considered this but were open to trying it. This led to two successful meetings and a dissemination event among the 6 fellows, IVVN and IDRC (see meeting minutes Sept 152021 and March 24th 2022), and several important recommendations from the fellows to improvements to the fellowship (see lessons at end).

Six scientific projects on vaccine development for veterinary pathogens were completed (Only reporting on the three funded by IDRC here).

Final report from Dr Laura Oliveira on Use of Molecular epidemiology of bovine Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae to guide vaccine development and improved control measures for contagious mastitis in Brazil

Scientific impact/achievements of her research with team - They uncovered unprecedented epidemiology of Staphylococcus aureus (SAU) and Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) from bovine milk in Brazil, and the results generated from this project have great potential for impact through future contagious bovine mastitis (CBM) control strategies and vaccine design. In addition, their results shed light on the epidemiologic scenario of piscine GBS in Brazil, where it has emerged as an important and potentially zoonotic pathogen in aquaculture. In terms of zoonotic potential, they also built a bridge with Brazilian veterinarians working in the field and farmers to establish a chain of communication to implement effective measures to reduce the rates of CBM and the risk of selection of AMR in Brazil....Collectively, the results generated from the project contribute to inform mastitis control and vaccine development recommendations, and to equip third-party laboratories in Brazil with tools for pathogen surveillance, allowing simultaneous diagnostic and strain-typing. It would also inform public health risks associated with GBS and SAU of bovine origin, based on AMR profiles and virulence factors. Their "MALDI-TOF" based diagnostic approach constitutes a model that can be adapted for other veterinary and human pathogens and success in the current study would provide proof-of-principle for future applications to other pathogens, diseases and production systems (from her final report).

Final report from Dr. Angela Makumi on Surveying Salmonella antigens for use in a bacteriophage-based vaccine enabling homologous and heterologous protection and colonization-inhibition effect in poultry.

Scientific impact/achievements of her research - Currently, the Salmonella vaccines available include live attenuated, inactivated (killed) and subunit vaccines. However, these vaccines are typically based on specific strains that are circulating in a particular region challenging the status quo of the efficacy of available vaccines. The fellowship allowed Angela and her team to understand the diversity of

--- Page 2 ---

Salmonella serovars circulating and based in the Kenyan poultry farms, and the application of a multivalent Salmonella vaccine product would also have the potential to significantly improve profitability across poultry food chains by reducing meat spoilage, limiting death caused by host specific Salmonella thereby contributing to the financial and the well-being of people in Kenya and its surrounding regions (from her final report).

Final report from Dr Mercy Yvonne Akinyi on Identification and characterization of circulating coronaviruses and host receptor diversity in non-human primates

Scientific impact/achievements of her research - This project has provided data and confirmed existing respiratory pathogens that are circulating in understudied non-human primates and their ACE2 host receptor diversity. Their results added to the scarce pathogen surveillance data for understudied primate species. The Colobus and Sykes monkeys are rarely studied yet some of these primate populations live in close proximity to humans and can thus act as sentinels for zoonoses. In addition, the data on host receptor diversity provides information on disease susceptibility of these non-human primates to Sars-Cov-2 virus. In the light of the on-going pandemic, this information can be used to educate communities that interact with primates on disease transmission between humans and wildlife. It can also contribute to the development of primate conservation and management practices. Their project concluded that continuous pathogen screening, typing and creation of a database is critical in monitoring reservoirs of epidemic pathogens and this in turn would provide a starting point for vaccine development in the event of an outbreak (from her final report).

Final scientific reporting from the three fellows funded by IDRC (the three IVVN funded fellows have not all finished their projects at the time of writing this PCR):

Final report from Dr Laura Oliveira on Use of Molecular epidemiology of bovine Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae to guide vaccine development and improved control measures for contagious mastitis in Brazil

Scientific impact/achievements of her research reported above.
Publications, presentations, and training- Laura published 1 journal article as first author, made three presentations at international and national conferences, and the team have 12 additional manuscripts in the works using results from the IVVN project with Laura as both as first author on 4 and as co-author on 9. At the end of 2021, Laura was awarded a 4-year post-doctoral fellowship ( $£ 50,000$ ) by the Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro - FAPERJ, which is a scientific funding agency that belongs to the Rio de Janeiro state's government, and which allows her to continue to work on manuscripts from the IVVN/IDRC-funded project. Through the fellowship Laura was able to take several online professional development courses to improve her scientific and project management skills.

Databases - Laura's project sequenced the whole genomes of GBS and SAU isolates from animal origins, which will be made available for public use through public data repositories (see her report for details).

Patent - Laura and the team intend to patent their MALDI-ToF MS-based strain-typing method to get recognition of the development of this new method via a patent, without commercial purposes.

Award - At the beginning of 2022, she was awarded a place at the Future Leaders Against AMR programme, an international and interdisciplinary programme for students and early-career professionals, designed to support their development as future leaders in the work against antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

Publications, presentations and training - Angela is lead author on one publication and book chapter; received follow-on funding to continue with research; made two conference presentations; three training sessions on grant writing, project management and ethics and experimental design.

Towards the end of her fellowship Angela was successful in competing for a Junior Scientist position at ILRI.

Final report from Dr Mercy Yvonne Akinyi on Identification and characterization of circulating coronaviruses and host receptor diversity in non-human primates

Scientific impact/achievements of her research reported above
Publications, presentations and training - Mercy is in the process of writing of several manuscripts with her mentors to be submitted to scientific journals; She presented the results from this study at two workshops.

A critical piece of equipment for her lab, a nanopore sequencer, was procured via her fellowship funding to screen for viruses detected during pathogen screening (to stay at her home Institute of Primate Research).

She used some of her fellowship funding to recruit two male research interns, who later were both able to secure research jobs due to their acquiring prerequisite molecular biology skills while attached to Mercy's lab.

As part of her professional development as a woman in the STEM field, this project provided an opportunity to mentor 3 research fellows and 2 masters' students.

Project Outcomes
How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?
Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

Women continue to be underrepresented in science, particularly in LMICs. Feedback from IVVN members has highlighted the importance of mentorship, particularly for female IVVN members based in LMICs. There are few women working in the field of veterinary vaccinology, holding junior or senior positions, resulting in lack of mentorship and lack of gender parity on boards, expert review panels and other forums that influence and shape entire fields of research. It was important to provide a fellowship programme specifically for women early career researchers in LMICs that provided financial support in addition to mentorship and opportunities to build capacity within the LMIC veterinary vaccinology organisations they are working in.

Through this project, IDRC was able to hear directly from women early career scientists in LMICs about the specific challenges they face in terms of career advancement. This insight can help inform and

--- Page 5 ---

strengthen future fellowship programs. In both meetings that brought together the cohort of fellows, time was set aside to ask the fellows to elaborate on the challenges they have observed and provide recommendations for granting institutions such as IDRC to improve future fellowship programs and provide additional supports to address these challenges. These recommendations are shared in section 8 of this PCR.

How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?
Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

The project achieved what it set out to do, namely, to build capacity of early career female researchers in veterinary vaccinology in LMICs, with IDRC and IVVN each providing support for three fellowships, for a total of six. The fellowship programme was greatly appreciated by the fellows, and the range of outputs and overall impact on the fellow's careers have been wide ranging.

Unintended outcomes were related to COVID-19. The pandemic highlighted the recurrent problem African research institutions face with the lack of a fast system to procure lab materials (consumables, lab reagents, etc.). Delays in the procurement process are especially a concern for short term projects like these fellowships and required very rigorous planning to procure all the materials in time for the projects to finish. Some of the fellows were able to borrow reagents from other research groups, but this took time due to increased levels of country clearance. Another impact from COVID-19 was limited access to the labs due to pandemic restrictions. Most of the fellows' work was lab-based and required them to adapt their project objectives to the new situation. IDRC granted a 6-month no-cost extension which allowed fellows to complete most of their milestones.

COVID-19 also affected travel and the important face-to-face mentoring that was expected with their international mentors during these fellowships. Travel funds were reallocated other activities in the projects (consumables and equipment). In all cases they moved to effective on-line mentoring, and while the pandemic did not jeopardize the fellowship and mentee/mentor relationship, the fellows missed out on much hands-on technical training and more close engagement with their mentors. They also missed on attending and presenting in-person at conferences and professional development courses outside their countries.

How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?
Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.

Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy.
Provide specific numbers where possible.
This project presented an opportunity for IDRC to support the empowerment of women veterinary vaccinology scientists in Africa, where research funding for career development is competitive, limited and mainly undertaken by international donors. In this resource-limited environment, the career trajectory of women suffers, and they are often unable to realize

--- Page 6 ---

their full potential. The project contributed to IDRC's development outcomes on gender equality by supporting African women veterinary vaccinology post-doctoral scientists to exert more control over their career development as they undergo formal mentorship from senior scientists. This project also directly contributes to the Sustainable Development Goal 5 to achieve gender equality for all women and girls.

This project also addresses IDRC's strategic objective of supporting leaders. It provided support for six female post-doctoral fellows from Africa to conduct research and other activities that contribute to establishment of a successful career in veterinary immunology. IVVN has received excellent feedback from the women who were supported in these fellowships. In an area where more women voices are needed and that has
traditionally been controlled by male scientists, the recipients of these awards have been supported to advance their careers and to potentially become leaders who are able to do excellent science and also become advocates of better policies and support for upcoming women scientists in this area.

Financial performance
Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

IVVN managed the entire fellowship process, from launch to review to engagement with the fellows and their reporting. It was discovered late, after handover from former responsible officer, that one of the fellows (Dr Angela Makumi at ILRI) was also receiving funds as a researcher in an IDRC-funded project to ILRI (Innovet-AMR project \#109049 on Kenya phages). My email about this is on file. Perhaps a lesson for the future, if we run these fellowships again with IVVN, is to consider making a condition that

--- Page 7 ---

those applying can not already be receiving funding from a current IDRC-funded project, to avoid 'double-dipping'. Or make clear conditions that they need to provide more detailed reports on how the funds will be used.

Over several conversations with Carly and Tim in late 2020, the Responsible Officer recommended they consider holding a series of learning/sharing events to bring the fellows together virtually to exchange about their experiences as women in science. IVVN was open to this, and it led to two events plus a final dissemination event, mentioned earlier (and on file). From these meetings, the fellows made some recommendations for the fellowship program that should be discussed if IDRC decides to fund any future fellowships with IVVN, including:

Fellowships should be longer than the 9-11-month duration and suggest 1-2 years;
More networking and exchange opportunities over the course of the program (e.g. an inaugural meeting, a mid-program meeting and an end-of-program meeting) and in-person as much as possible;

Opportunities to network with older fellows and women scientists, and to have a mentorship platform beyond the individual mentor-mentee relationships;

Fellows would value the opportunity to interact with previous IVVN/IDRC programme fellows. As this was the first year of this particular programme, this could be implemented in future years;

IVVN could provide more support to better support challenges faced by women ECRs in LMICs including having a higher percentage of salary covered by the fellowship and maternity policies/clauses in fellowship terms and conditions;

Allow fellows to apply who are not attached to an institution;
Have training opportunities on project management, leadership, and grant writing provided by other organizations; and

Fellows highlighted the importance of the gender impacts of their research, for example the importance of poultry for women farmers. This could be something for the fellowship to explore putting more emphasis on in the future (vaccinology research that impacts women farmers more directly).

During the final dissemination event IVVN indicated they were very supportive of these suggestions and would further develop the fellowship programme to aim to address the above.

In February 2022, IVVN submitted another proposal to LVIF for funding. The Responsible Officer was asked to review the proposal (Feb/22 review on file) for the PL. IVVN has done a lot with what appears to be a modest amount of funding over their past 5-year strategy. One of their aims moving forward is to "promote gender balance in vet vaccinology research", however upon review, it appears to continue to be siloed into their African Schools Outreach Programme (ASOP) and the IVVN fellowships that IDRC supported, rather than having gender equality as a cross cutting objective. In past exchanges with Tim, he indicated that it was their aim for better gender balance in all areas of IVVN activities, however the current proposal does not reflect this. LVIF has not yet committed to supporting IVVN's broader proposal as we were awaiting finalizing the on-going projects before starting anything new. Their proposal does mentions collaborating the African Vaccinology Network (AfVANET), a new network of African research scientists involved in vaccine research and development (R\&D;) for human and animal diseases that started in 2019. The Responsible Officer was not familiar with AfVANET and wonders if

--- Page 8 ---

this might be a preferable vaccine network for IDRC to consider supporting in the future, rather than the UK-based IVVN, or a combination/collaborative fellowship program between the two networks.

# Strategic Considerations 

Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

The PAD mentioned a low risk in the capacity of the IVVN to manage the fellowships in a manner that ensures women fellows take ownership of their projects and career development and feel empowered to do so. This mitigation strategy was to discuss in detail with IVVN during the RFP development and IVVN agreed to consult and receive guidance from IDRC in this area. It resulted in a major re-writing of the RFP and development of an evaluation matrix and mentorship program that is centred on the woman fellow. The Responsible Officer remained engaged with the recipient throughout the project selection process as well as during implementation to provide IDRC experience in this area.

Another risk was that fellows could be discouraged from applying due to parental duties, potentially resulting in insufficient applicants. To mitigate this, the fellowship application was revised to allow for selected fellows to defer their start date if necessary to accommodate parental leave. During the dissemination event, fellows also raised the need for maternity leave policies in future fellowships.

The Covid-19 pandemic was an unanticipated risk which caused interruptions and delays to the projects. IDRC granted the project a six month no-cost extension which allowed IVVN to facilitate extensions to the fellowships where required. The pandemic also changed the nature of the mentee-mentor relationship, with all meetings taking place online and planned travel cancelled and reallocated to equipment or research. Despite the challenges caused by Covid-19, the fellows achieved a remarkable amount during the projects and all fellows were pleased with the support they received from their mentors

Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

Research ethics of all submitted fellowship applications were assessed during peer review of each application by one external and two internal reviewers. Fellows also went through their home institution's ethics review processes. There were no unforeseen ethical issues with the six funded fellowships.

## Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

This is a well written PCR. As noted above, to better incorporate gender equity across all LVIF programming (including vaccine discovery and development), LVIF dedicated approximately 20\% of its funds to develop projects that target women's participation and benefit from agricultural and livestock systems for increased livestock productivity and improved household food security. One advantage of

--- Page 9 ---

the design of the LVIF program is the phased approach that allows taking decisions on investments and projects in a more dynamic way. The integration of upstream-downstream initiatives also reinforces the program approach to integrate elements, such as gender approaches, in a more transversal way rather than project by project.

In this project, LVIF focused specifically on strengthening the participation and empowerment of women scientists in LMICs. Lack of sufficient career mentorship coupled with family responsibilities have been identified as major impediments to the advancement of early career women scientists in LMICs. This project facilitated the career progression of six early career women in LMICs and strengthened their capacity to perform high quality veterinary vaccine research. The professional outcomes for the six women, as a result of the fellowships, greatly exceed expectations. A wide range of high-quality outputs have been documented, including examples of capacity building, creating new networks, engagement with media, numerous first and co-author scientific publications, technical and professional training, follow on funding and presenting results at scientific meetings. Furthermore, the project has resulted in many opportunities for the fellows which would not have been possible without the fellowship programme.

This project was also successful in meeting LVIF's partnership strategy as we leveraged funding from IVVN (who funded 3 out of 6 fellowships). These relatively limited funds have greatly increased our visibility within the larger livestock R4D community through the various webinars, papers and synthesis materials which have been developed for the whole set of 6 fellows. LVIF is therefore associated to this entire work that draw wider lessons on what has been learned on supporting women in science. Kudos to Wendy who took over and successfully delivered this project. Also, to Evelyn Baraké who provided considerable behind the scenes support. On numerous occasions, colleagues at IVVN commented on both of their positive contributions to the project.
