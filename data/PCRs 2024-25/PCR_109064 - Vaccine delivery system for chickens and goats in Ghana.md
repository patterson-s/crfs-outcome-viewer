## Project Abstract

In Ghana, 63% of the extremely poor depend on agriculture for their livelihoods, with women representing most of this population. However, Ghanaian women own fewer livestock, use less fertilizer, own less mechanical equipment, have fewer years of education and lower school attendance rates than men. Backyard poultry and goat production systems are prevalent in Ghana, and play an important role in the livelihoods of women farmers who are usually in charge of these species. Newcastle Disease, Peste des Petits Ruminants, and Contagious Caprine Pleuropneumonia are primary causes of death for chicken and goats. Although vaccines exist in Ghana, they are often inaccessible for women due to a variety of barriers including delivery systems that are not centered on women's needs, preferences and capabilities, mobility challenges for women livestock owners and gender norms that affect women's ownership and management of livestock. The project will test a gender transformative approach that addresses women's vaccine access constraints. In addition, the approach will study gender norms and social barriers that constrain women from accessing, using and making decisions on the use and benefits from vaccines. The research will provide comparative empirical evidence on the effectiveness of this gender transformative approach compared to a gender accommodating approach for vaccine delivery systems in the country. The project will identify specific women's needs, priorities and constraints, and develop ways to address them so that animal health service providers and women farmers benefit from an improved vaccine delivery system. Evidence will be used to make recommendations on what approach works best for addressing gender-based constraints in access to and use of vaccines for improving the livelihoods of women livestock owners

## PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

deliver 30,000 peste des petits ruminants vaccines in 9 additional districts in Northern Ghana. In addition, Cowtribe and CARE Ghana have been invited to be involved as technical partners for the Strengthening Animal Systems Project, a partnership between the UK Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and the Government of Ghana.

2. Generated deep insights on social and gender norms in project locations, their effect on female livestock keepers and animal health service providers and approaches to address the norms. This project systematically tested a gender accommodative (i.e. gender responsive) approach against a gender transformative one to analyse the magnitude of changes to gender norms and empowerment between communities where each approach was implemented. Endlines showed a marked improvement in the empowerment of women involved in the project, particularly in the gender transformative approach communities, which was connected to changes in norms and to access to animal health services. Findings demonstrate that restrictive norms must first be addressed for technical livestock interventions to meaningfully support women's empowerment and increase vaccine access.

3. Successfully piloted technological approaches to deliver and scale-up gender-responsive animal health services. Through its partnership with Cowtribe, a private-sector animal health services technology platform, the project piloted multiple technology-driven approaches to deliver animal health service to underserved women livestock keepers. Short informative audio messages delivered via cell phone were found to be particularly useful to reach women directly who previously relied on information filtered through male household members. Delivery of livestock vaccines to rural health clinics via drone and distributed through a network of lead farmers (mostly women) also successfully increased vaccine access. However, their findings show a strong interdependence between social and technological approaches, emphasizing that existing "root norms" constraining women's participation in livestock rearing (e.g. women can't rear livestock; women vets cannot treat animals) need to be addressed first for the technology-driven approaches to be effective.

4. Generated critical insights on the Women's Empowerment in Livestock (WELI) tool, the first index of its kind to measure changes in empowerment in livestock systems. Endlines revealed a counter-intuitive finding: women in communities where gender transformative approaches were implemented had a lower empowerment score than at baseline. Additional qualitative fieldwork revealed that this was due to changes in women's understanding of empowerment over the project lifetime and to their increased ability and confidence to express themselves (i.e. empowerment was overreported at baseline). This apparent decrease in score actually indicates a positive change. This and other findings on the WELI will help ILRI further refine the tool and support its use in future projects.

5. Generating new findings about scaling gender-transformative impact, and insights into "tipping points" for fostering sustainable change in norms and behaviours beyond the lifetime of action research projects, and potential spillover effects to communities who did not receive the intervention. Initial findings show that while there is evidence of strong norm change as a result of the interventions, especially for communities who participated in gender-transformative interventions, it is "sticky" to the domain in question and there is no evidence that increased decision-making or women in livestock systems has transferred into other domains. The research team is continuing to analyse these findings post-project.

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

## 4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

This project contributed many scientific articles on barriers and opportunities for women in the Livestock Vaccines Value Chain (LVVC) and mapped out and engaged critical stakeholders. They have tested a scalable model for empowering women to contribute to and benefit from the LVVC. Cowtribe, a third-party, was a key private sector partner for this project. This was the only team in the cohort to systematically testing gender transformative approaches against gender responsive approaches that focus on improving household wellbeing through increased livestock productivity, food security, and livelihoods. The project has tested and used innovative tools to work with stakeholders, such as adapting CARE's Farmer Field and Business School to livestock, to monitor changes as a result of the interventions, such as the WELI and the WELBI (Women's Empowerment in Livestock Business Index – measures changes in empowerment among livestock service providers) and the RHoMIS (Rural Household Multi-Indicator Survey), and to improve livestock service delivery, such as informational audio clips and drone delivery.

This research was important to fund, as it filled a critical knowledge and evidence gap on how to address the widespread barriers and limitations impeding women from participating and/or fully benefiting from the livestock vaccine chain. Contributions include:

- Mapping the livestock vaccine delivery system in Northern Ghana, as well as documenting women's roles in it. This includes collecting and analysing by gender community members' motivations to rear animals, the distribution of labour, and local perceptions/understanding of empowerment.
- Adding to scholarship on social norms and gender equality. The team documented gender norms linked to women's participation in livestock rearing and tested how these respond to gender responsive and gender transformative approaches. The project found that some gender norms became less restrictive, and the effect was stronger in communities where gender transformative approaches were used.
- Generating evidence on the institutional requirements for a vaccine delivery system that responds to the needs to women service providers and livestock farmers. This includes the need to attract and train more women as animal health service providers and veterinarians to better serve women, to integrate gender in training curricula for technical veterinary students, and the dependency on gender transformative approaches for technical interventions to be effective.
- Providing a case study for scaling up gender transformative impacts. Gender transformative approaches clearly emerged as a precondition for other interventions to have a positive impact at scale. In this project, communities first needed to appreciate women's role in livestock and accept that women can and should manage livestock before the technological interventions to scale up service to women could be effective. The project also generated interesting insights on possible "tipping points" for sustainable norm change, geographical positive spillovers from interventions, and the possibility of norm change extending into other domains – this analysis is ongoing.

# 5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

This project is made up of a strong team of gender experts from ILRI and CARE who are committed to, and believe in, feminist approaches, women's empowerment and participatory approaches. The structure of the LVIF call, requiring gender leads as the PIs was essential to its success. The length of this PCR section will testify to the fact that projects with a gender-transformative ambition using mixed-methods and participatory approaches are complex and benefit considerably from a strong relationship with the IDRC responsible officer and from participating in a cohort in order to adapt to situational challenges and achieve results.

There were initial coordination challenges among the three partners (ILRI was responsible for the research, CARE for implementing the gender work and farmer field business school, and Cowtribe managed the vaccines and cold chain) and it took several years for them to work across their siloes as a team. The gender analysis of Cowtribe's performance and operations early on helped improve their business model and realize the importance of the project's objectives. The project faced some initial delays, as the former lead PI from ILRI departed in the first few months of the project, leaving the position essentially empty for nearly six months. The lack of communication from ILRI during this period was frustrating for the Responsible Officer and the CARE PI, however once Alessandra stepped in, things improved.

In late 2019, it was one of two projects in the women's empowerment cohort that was considered and received supplementary funding to scale results. A new objective was added, and the team committed to reaching double the number of smallholders (from 20 communities and 2,000 farmers to 40 communities and 4,000 farmers) and scale the Gender Transformative FFBS model in 10 new villages in each of the two project sites. Over the course of the project, 4,000 women have signed up for Cowtribe's platform, 3,000 people attended participatory sessions to reflect on cultural attitudes and gender norms, 150 lead farmers were trained to store and administer i2 Newcastle Disease vaccines (including 105 women) and 10,000 vaccine doses were distributed annually.

COVID-19-related shutdowns and movement restrictions halted field related activities in 2020. The team was nearly a year behind in implementation of activities. To mitigate, they reverted to virtual meetings and discussions, including for writeshops, and conducted telephone surveys with participants. IDRC granted all 4 projects in the cohort, including this one, an extension enabling them to complete activities as planned. This team also supported the COVID-19 response efforts (providing masks, soap, PPE) to mitigate impact in the communities where they are engaged.

The project was extended a second time, along with the other projects in the cohort, providing additional time for knowledge sharing activities and to complete their endline data gathering. From IDRC's perspective, it also eased the logistical burden of attending Women Deliver, which took place in Kigali July 2023 and was the venue for the final dissemination and workshop, enabling the full cohort to gather in person for the first time since the inception workshop. In July as the team was slated to finish the last of the fieldwork exercise, an Anthrax outbreak prevented the ILRI staff from travelling, causing further delay. A final extension was granted to enable the fieldwork to take place in September 2024 – the team also used this additional time as an opportunity to investigate the counterintuitive quantitative findings related to decreases in WELI scores (see section 1 point #4) and hired a world-renowned consultant on gender

norms to analyze and publish the findings, which would not have been possible without the extending and supplementing the project.

Most intended outcomes were achieved, and apart from the many impacts of COVID-19, results are in line with what was anticipated. Unexpected outcomes include the following:

- The project hypothesized that norms would shift as a result of gender transformative interventions. This loosening of gender norms was already evident in midline reporting, indicating that norm change can happen relatively quickly.

- While the project anticipated that timely vaccination would reduce livestock mortality, risks related to extensive livestock keeping somewhat mitigated the positive effects of vaccination. In post vaccination survey over 25% of farmers reported animals are healthier and strong while about 50% reported that animals some of their animals are healthy and others have died. A bird flu outbreak affected flock sizes, and the early emergence of lush grasses which can poison goats due to heavy spring rains led to the cancellation of some PPR vaccination campaigns by regional veterinary directorate, as the farmers may misattribute animal death to the vaccine. Addressing livestock mortality by collaborating with government vets was essential to create awareness and offer treatment.

- Limited availability of women veterinarians in the government system led the project to recruit women vets for Cowtribe, which was a difficult process. This highlighted the need for vet training institutions to invest in attracting more women. The team has shared its findings relating to the importance of women vets to government stakeholders.

- An opportunity arose for Cowtribe to partner with Zipline, a company with experience delivering human vaccines to remote locations, to deliver animal vaccines to remote livestock farmers. This is the first pilot known to be testing the delivery of animal vaccines by drone and proved a successful approach.

- Cowtribe was initially perceived as a competitor by government veterinarians who were concerned about job security and the quality of private sector service delivery. The team strived to build a good relationship with the government vets, which helped ensure the project could move forward smoothly. This included giving the government vet officers joint access to the cold chain infrastructure set up by the project, keeping them well informed of the project's vaccination campaigns, and referring livestock farmers to government vets for treatment.

- The Women's Empowerment in Livestock Index (WELI) was a common tool that IDRC asked the cohort of 4 LVIF women's empowerment projects to adopt to create the possibility of meta-analysis for stronger data and greater impact of findings on women's empowerment. Under another CRFS project (RSP 109786), the CGIAR Gender Platform (lead by ILRI) has been contracted to synthesize IDRC's use of Women's Empowerment Indicators, drawing on the experiences from the 12 IDRC projects (8 from CultiAF and 4 from LVIF). However, the WELI is more of a pilot tool, requiring more resources than anticipated and all the LVIF teams had difficulty cleaning and analyzing their baseline data. It took much more resources than anticipated (time and budgeted), and all 4 LVIF teams ended up hiring biostatisticians to support this work. This project's seemingly counterintuitive finding about a lower WELI score at endline indicating an increase in empowerment (see section 1 point #4) will undoubtedly support future projects using this tool.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC’s strategic objectives?
Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.
Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy.
Provide specific numbers where possible.

The project contributes to IDRC outcomes on **gender equality** by facilitating women’s empowerment through training and access to resources and focuses on the prevention of emerging infectious diseases and zoonotic disease, leading to improved livestock health and productivity. It also enhances women’s economic empowerment and leadership. The project is also well aligned with the CRFS (and IDRC’s) gender strategy on promoting gender-transformative approaches with a high potential to change existing gender norms towards gender equality. The contributions towards this outcome were highlighted through the final dissemination activities that took place at Women Deliver 2023 in Kigali, an important global forum for advancing gender equality.

**Impact at scale**: During its 4-year duration, the project worked with at least 4,000 women livestock keepers and their households. The project is expected to reach many more through a partnership between Cowtribe and the Government to scale up the delivery model in nine additional districts in Northern Ghana to deliver 30,000 doses of the PPR vaccine (MoU signed).

**Building leaders for today and tomorrow**: The project will strengthen CARE’s leadership on integrating gender in agriculture and food security programming. It will also build community leaders through targeted trainings and capacity development of 30 community AHSP. Based on recommendations from key stakeholders in the animal health service delivery sector, CARE Ghana and Cowtribe have been engaged as technical resource partners by the UK’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) to support the integration of gender and digital vaccine livery systems, respectively

Partner of Choice: The project was funded through LVIF, a donor-partnership program comprising IDRC, Global Affairs Canada, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Ghana is one of the countries of focus for livestock of the BMGF.

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

Personnel costs for ILRI were initially at 46% of the total budget and reduced to 35% after the responsible officer requested a revised budget. The personnel costs are still higher than the 25% recommended by IDRC, however justifiable given the scope of work and activities taking place and the need to ensure quality results. Women's empowerment in the livestock value chain is a relatively new area of development research, with few institutions experienced in this niche. The CARE and ILRI team represent a high calibre set of researchers with extensive field and project management experience on gender integration and vaccine development and delivery. IDRC should review its cap on personnel costs for this type of social science research if we expect high quality results from high calibre teams.

The flexibility in IDRC granting allowed the team extensions that were critical as the team lost nearly a full year due to the pandemic, and to take advantage of the major Women Deliver Conference in Kigali in July 2023 to disseminate their findings at a side event, alongside the other projects in the cohort. In July as the team was slated to finish the last of the fieldwork exercise, an Anthrax outbreak prevented the ILRI staff from travelling, causing further delay. A final extension was granted to enable the fieldwork to take place in September 2024, along with a supplement, as the team was stretched thin due to the initial no-cost extension. The team made a strong case to use the additional time and resources to investigate the counterintuitive quantitative findings related to decreases in WELI scores and hired a world-renowned consultant on gender norms to analyse and publish the findings, which would not have been possible without the extending and supplementing the project.

Regular bi-monthly check-in meetings with IDRC were critical to give immediate feedback rather than waiting at the end of the reporting period.

## The cohort model

As this project was one among four that responded to an LVIF call for proposals on addressing dimensions of gender inequalities and barriers in the LVVC, and with similar start and end times, the Responsible Officer brought the cohort together at regular intervals to exchange and share learnings with high turnout. The goal was to build a body of evidence and comparable results that can have greater impact and policy influence and create opportunities for joint capacity building. It also fostered deeper shared learning, stimulated peer-to-peer exchanges, cross-project learning and collaboration across countries and projects. Feedback from the teams indicated it was a value add to their projects and a positive experience. All the projects adapted, clarified, and strengthened their methodologies through their participation in the cohort, and collaborating on advocacy contributed to stronger impacts. Inviting in outside experts to presentation and critique provided opportunities for project reflections.

Once COVID-19 related restrictions eased and fieldwork resumed, the CoP meetings ceased as teams were suddenly very busy catching up on lost time. Had there been a point person to lead collaborative activities on each team, the CoP momentum might have been sustained. There were also suggestions to have technical projects (upstream) involved in the cohort from the start to facilitate interaction and mutual learning between gender/social scientists and product development-focused scientists, which would have allowed them to adapt their projects to the learning along the way, instead of waiting to have the first full LVIF learning event in November of 2022 and at the end of the programme in November 2023. The projects also reflected that there would be an opportunity for much more cross-project synthesis, leveraging the significant body of comparable evidence that was generated across all four projects. Facilitating this in the context of EFPs, given project timelines and funding envelopes, is a challenge for IDRC to reflect upon.

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

epidemics: first, the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced teams to shift to virtual work where possible and developing implementation strategy while fieldwork was at a standstill; second the Anthrax outbreak which delayed endline data collection. In both cases, IDRC granted extensions to enable the work to go forward.

This project was funded through the Livestock Vaccine Innovation Fund (LVIF), which was co-funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), Global Affairs Canada (GAC) and IDRC. The fund was a 57$ CAD partnership of 8 years. It ended in March 2024. The Fund initially had a huge interest from GAC to have projects reaching women farmers while BMGF were less interested in the downstream type projects. BMGF did demonstrate a lot of interest as the projects moved along. A gender specialist working group was created by IDRC to discuss the best way to incorporate gender into the vaccine value chain for animals through a Call for Proposals. One of the main recommendations that came along was requiring gender leads as the PIs (not vaccine expert). Therefore, IDRC launched a closed call for proposals on addressing dimensions of gender inequalities and barriers in the livestock vaccine value chain. This project was one of 4 selected projects. IDRC really adopted a cohort approach with bringing the 4 projects together on a regular interval. The teams were also asked by IDRC to adopt the Women's Empowerment in Livestock Index (WELI) tool to create the possibility of meta-analysis for stronger data and greater impact of findings on women's empowerment.

This project demonstrated a good engagement from government. The project also tested various technological innovations such as drone vaccine delivery. They reached their goal of reaching and involving women within the livestock vaccine value chain. The project is now also expanding the results of this project in other regions in Ghana as well as in other countries (Kenya). This was a very successful project with a lot of potential for expansion and scaling.

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

The PO and PL described in this PCR crucial lessons from this project for future similar interventions, which address restrictive social and gender norms for technical livestock interventions to meaningfully support women's empowerment and increase vaccine access. The project found that gender transformative approaches were more effective than gender-accommodative ones in changing norms and empowering women. The project supported IDRC and CRFS 2030 vision by contributing to IDRC outcomes on gender equality, facilitating women's empowerment through training and access to resources, and focusing on preventing emerging infectious diseases and zoonotic diseases, leading to improved livestock health and productivity. It also enhanced women's economic empowerment and leadership. The project team effectively applied almost all risk mitigation measures outlined in the Project Approval Document. They also successfully managed unanticipated risks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and an Anthrax

outbreak, by shifting to virtual work where possible, developing an implementation strategy while fieldwork was at a standstill, and obtaining extensions from IDRC to enable the work to progress.

Partnerships like the LVIF one are essential to ensure long-term investments and cross-programming learning from upstream research to downstream implementation. The LVIF partnership, which comprises IDRC, Global Affairs Canada, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, is an example of such a partnership. It provides funding and support for projects addressing gender inequalities and barriers in the livestock vaccine value chain. This partnership enables sharing of knowledge, resources, and expertise, leading to more effective and sustainable outcomes.
