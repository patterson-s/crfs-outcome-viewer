# Project Abstract

This project aimed to evaluate a One Health model for scaling up the use of the Cysvax vaccine against porcine cysticercosis caused by the zoonotic parasite Taenia solium. This approach involved coordinated efforts in both animal and human health sectors, with sustainability and replicability as key considerations. Led by the University of Melbourne, in collaboration with FOFIFA, the Ministry of Health, and other partners like the WHO and the Indian Ocean Commission, the project focused on minimal interventions while maximizing learning opportunities.

Baseline data collected in 2021 revealed alarmingly high prevalence rates of  $T.$  solium in pigs (31%-36%) and lower but still significant rates in humans (1.25%). Key interventions on the animal side included setting up a National Animal Ethics Committee, renovating diagnostic facilities, and conducting widespread pig vaccinations and treatments. The project also facilitated mass drug administration by the Ministry of Health, treating approximately 117,000 individuals with praziquantel. Despite challenges, such as delays due to adverse events and varying coverage levels, the project achieved notable success in reducing disease prevalence.

The final evaluation in 2023 showed a significant decrease in porcine cysticercosis prevalence (8% viable cysts) but only a slight reduction in human taeniasis (0.63%). Despite the efficacy of pig vaccinations, continued parasite transmission was evident, highlighting the need for sustained efforts. Additional activities, including surveys on knowledge and economic impact, provided valuable insights and support for the project's objectives.

Moreover, the project conducted a field trial comparing alternative vaccine formulations, yielding promising results comparable to the commercial Cysvax vaccine. Despite setbacks, such as a tragic car accident involving project personnel, the team's resilience and commitment ensured project continuity.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC·CRDI

In conclusion, this project represents a significant advancement in combating *T. solium* transmission through a comprehensive One Health approach. By addressing both animal and human aspects of the disease, implementing minimal interventions, and fostering collaboration among various stakeholders, the project lays the groundwork for broader adoption and sustainability of control measures. Through its achievements and lessons learned, this project serves as a valuable model for future *T. solium* control efforts worldwide.

## PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

a. The large-scale pig vaccination and treatment was very effective in Malagasy conditions, and the One Health programme was very successful in decreasing the prevalence of *T. solium* cysticercosis from 31% of viable cysts (baseline) to 8% (final evaluation).

b. This project marked the largest One Health *T. solium* control program ever implemented and the first to be implemented as a public health program. A total of 117,216 people were treated (116,061 with Praziquantel, 615 with Niclosamide). A total of 125,652 pigs were vaccinated. The average coverage was 62.5%.

c. The Ministry of Health is currently preparing a National Plan on control of Cysticercosis in Madagascar based on the model from this project. The **WHO AFRO** is also beginning to promote the protocol on managing adverse events for Schistosomiasis treatment around the world based on the protocol developed in this project.

d. The project's initiative led to the establishment of the National Animal Ethics Committee by the Government of Madagascar, which is housed inside the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Livestock. This committee followed international standards and drew upon guidelines such as the Australian code for animal care and use in scientific research.

e. A novel vaccine adjuvant was evaluated in the field, demonstrating significantly better performance than the currently used one. The formulation belongs to a commercial company, and negotiations regarding intellectual property and rights are underway with assistance from the BMGF. Results were submitted to IDRC separately due to proprietary information.

3. If appropriate, explain why outputs were not completed or were of poor quality.

Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

a. A severe car accident involving key project personnel resulted in one fatality and three injuries among the project key personnel. Despite their injuries, they demonstrated remarkable dedication by returning to work promptly, albeit with ongoing health issues. Additional temporary personnel were enlisted to support the project. Unfortunately, one key personnel's recovery was hindered, requiring further surgery in 2024.
b. Tragic the passing of a veterinarian from FOFIFA who was instrumental on supporting the field work during the project audit in late 2023 further disrupted project continuity.
c. Financial challenges arose during discussions for a non-cost extension, with FOFIFA expressing concerns about cash flow. Despite assurances of additional payments for an extra financial report, no such compensation materialized, causing project implementation constraint hence necessitating internal adjustments to meet project deadlines.
d. The COVID-19 pandemic hindered in-person meetings until January 2023. However, frequent virtual meetings via Zoom facilitated communication.
e. Collaboration with the schistosomiasis program to enhance project efficiency faced timing and priority mismatches. With WHO's assistance, efforts to negotiate flexibility with donors of the schistosomiasis program led to improved cooperation and future collaboration between the programs.
f. The Ministry of Health suspended mass drug administrations, including *T. solium* treatment, after a child's death during the schistosomiasis program in 2021. Subsequent procedural reviews and additional training, supported by WHO, eventually allowed the resumption of *T. solium* treatment.
g. Farmer reluctance towards pig vaccination, exacerbated by negative perceptions surrounding vaccines, posed a challenge. Lessons learned emphasized the importance of involving community leaders, joint awareness efforts by veterinary and medical teams, and effective communication strategies.
h. Challenges in accurately measuring vaccine coverage highlighted the need for strategic operational planning, including adjusting vaccinator schedules, addressing logistical

issues, and managing rumors effectively. Proactive measures such as advance notification and community engagement were identified to enhance coverage rates.

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?
Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

a. The project successfully validated a model for controlling *T. solium* that primarily relies on pig vaccination using the Cysvax® vaccine. This validation involved demonstrating the effectiveness, scalability, and sustainability of the model, which is crucial for future implementations in similar endemic regions. Madagascar is currently writing the National Plan on the control of cysticercosis based on the model. The Ministry of Health has been driving it and await input from the Veterinary Services.

b. The project achieved a significant reduction in porcine cysticercosis, with a notable decrease in the prevalence of viable cysts in pigs from baseline to final evaluation. This reduction is a direct outcome of the pig vaccination strategy employed by the project.

c. Although complete elimination of *T. solium* infection was not achieved, the project succeeded in reducing the human disease burden in the project areas. This reduction is evidenced by the decrease in the prevalence of human taeniasis, indicating progress towards mitigating the impact of the disease on the human population.

d. The project contributed to capacity building by training animal health vaccinators, health agents, and community health workers. It also conducted extensive awareness campaigns to educate communities about *T. solium* diseases and the importance of vaccination, thereby enhancing community participation and buy-in for control efforts.

e. The project introduced innovative approaches, such as utilizing traditional singers for awareness campaigns and implementing mass drug administration alongside the schistosomiasis program. These approaches not only enhanced outreach but also contributed to overcoming challenges, such as population reluctance following adverse events.

f. Through baseline surveys, the project generated valuable knowledge about the prevalence of *T. solium* infection, attitudes towards vaccination, and economic costs associated with the disease. This knowledge was shared with relevant stakeholders and contributed to broader discussions at international levels, potentially influencing future public health policies and programs.

g. The project fostered collaboration among various stakeholders, including government agencies, international organizations, and local communities. This collaborative approach enhances the sustainability and scalability of interventions beyond the project's duration.

h. The project's comprehensive approach, including research, capacity building, community engagement, and knowledge dissemination, contributes significantly to

advancing the field of *T. solium* control and has the potential for broader uptake and impact in endemic regions worldwide.

5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

a. The intended and actual results were largely congruent. The model for *T. solium* control based primarily on pig vaccination using the Cysvax vaccine was validated.
b. There were some challenges in accurately measuring vaccine coverage due to limitations in census methods and challenges in identifying all pigs needing vaccination. The variability in coverage levels across different areas, impacted overall effectiveness.
c. There were also some significant delays in project activities firstly due to Covid and then in mass treatment due to an adverse event in a neighboring district, leading to population reluctance and lower coverage.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC’s strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.

Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

- Invest in high-quality research and innovation in developing countries

This project provided a robust demonstration that when a One Health approach is used, centred on a large-scale pig vaccination and treatment as well as treating the human population, it can be very successful in decreasing the prevalence of *T. solium*.

- Share knowledge for greater uptake and use

The knowledge from this project is currently being used to design a National Plan for controlling Cysticercosis in Madagascar. Globally, the methods developed to manage adverse events are being promoted by WHO AFRO towards adoption for global application in managing similar cases for Schistosomiasis.

- Mobilize alliances for impact

This was a jointly funded project under the Livestock Vaccines Innovation Fund that brought together resources from three funders – IDRC, Gates Foundation and Global Affairs Canada.

☐ 1 Not met

Comment: The project has made considerable progress towards the goal of eliminating T. solium as a public health problem, as evidenced by the reduction in porcine cysticercosis prevalence. However, due to challenges in achieving high coverage rates in both pig vaccination (estimated around 65%) and human mass treatment (coverage around 62%), complete elimination has not yet been achieved. Despite this, the project has laid a strong foundation for further efforts to reduce the human disease burden caused by T. solium.

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC’s administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

a. The traffic accident involving project personnel on a project field trip set some precedence at IDRC in dealing with such an event. There was one fatality (third party) and three critically injured people (grantees/ sub-recipient employees). IDRC recognised the truly exceptional circumstances of this tragic accident, and was willing to recognize medical expenses incurred by FOFIFA in relation to the car accident as an eligible indirect cost subject to the following conditions:

- This exception was being made without prejudice to IDRC’s rights under the Grant Agreement, and did not constitute a waiver of any of the terms and conditions of the Grant Agreement,
- The medical expenses incurred by FOFIFA in relation to the car accident were to be treated as an eligible indirect expense only to the extent that any other sources of compensation available are insufficient to cover such costs, including but not limited to insurance proceeds, and regardless of whether such compensation has been received;

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC·CRDI

- The determination of whether to incur the expenses remained exclusively within the discretion of FOFIFA;
- IDRC reserved the right to refuse any future requests for similar expenses;
- FOFIFA recognized IDRC’s position that the granting of this exception does not, in law, constitute an express or implied admission of fault or liability by IDRC in connection with the incident; and
- The total amount budgeted for indirect expenses (456,721,600 MGA (152,618 CAD)) was to remain the same and would not be exceeded.

b. Delays in signing the Grant Agreements due to insurance requirements and the time needed to finalize an MoU between the grantees resulted in complications, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Future programming could benefit from streamlining administrative processes to ensure timely execution of Grant Agreements, especially considering potential unforeseen circumstances.

c. The COVID-19 pandemic caused disruptions, including loss of staff mobility and severe air-travel restrictions. Project teams need to anticipate such external challenges and develop robust mitigation measures to ensure project continuity. In this case, outsourcing critical activities to experts from regions less affected by restrictions helped overcome logistical hurdles.

d. Given the disruptions caused by the pandemic, the project duration was extended to accommodate delays. IDRC conducted a thorough review of revised budgets, reallocating funds as necessary to cover increased costs and accommodate changes in project timelines. This highlights the importance of flexibility in budget management and resource allocation to address unforeseen circumstances.

e. IDRC's thorough review of revised budgets ensured that any budget adjustments were justified and aligned with project needs. This approach maintains accountability and transparency in financial management, ensuring that funds are used efficiently and effectively to achieve project objectives.

f. The LVIF program had sufficient budget to cover justified costs, including increased personnel and travel expenses. Leveraging available funds from returned projects and currency exchange gains demonstrates prudent financial management and resource optimization.

g. Components must be in committed status in CRM to process a supplement. This highlights the importance of clear documentation and compliance with internal processes and systems to facilitate smooth administrative procedures.

# STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

Last Revised March 2021

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC·CRDI

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

- Risk mitigation was very effective. There was only one serious adverse event which was very well managed and served as an example for many other programs worldwide. The research work showed that the use of praziquantel for mass drug administration in patients already positive for Cysticercosis is not recommended. They should instead receive Niclosamide.
- One adverse effect in 2021 from another project on schistosomiasis (external to this IDRC funded project), that resulted in a child's death, made the Ministry of Health stop all human mass drug administration in the country for a period. This also affected human activities in this project. This had not been anticipated in the PAD.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

The main lesson from this project is that where there is no Ethics Review Board in a country, research funds can be used to set up one. A National Animal Ethics Committee based on the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/research-policy/ethics/animal-ethics was established in Madagascar through this project. This is a great contribution to a country as it paves way for more effective ethics management for future research work in that country.

## Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

This project was funded through the Livestock Vaccine Innovation Fund (LVIF), which was co-funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), Global Affairs Canada (GAC) and IDRC. The fund was a 57$ CAD partnership of 8 years. It ended in March 2024. LVIF adopted a strategic model that intervened at key entry points in the vaccine development, production, and access continuum. The Fund carried out research activities along three broad streams: cutting-edge vaccine development, vaccine improvement and manufacturing, and vaccine demand, access, and use. In the vaccine demand, access and use stream, IDRC launched a closed call for proposal that funded research projects that focused on scale and delivery scale projects. A total of 2 projects were funded in this closed call. One in Ethiopia and this one based in Madagascar. Grantees in this stream of research were a mix of academic and, government from the human and animal sector.

This project focused on validating a One Health model for controlling Taenia solium through pig vaccination, aiming for sustainability and scalability in Madagascar. The initiative was led by the University of Melbourne in collaboration with various stakeholders, including health ministries and international organizations. The project aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the

Cysvax vaccine against porcine cysticercosis, integrating efforts from both animal and human health sectors. Baseline data showed high prevalence rates of T. solium in pigs (31%-36%) and humans (1.25%). Successful interventions included establishing a National Animal Ethics Committee and conducting mass drug administration for humans through collaboration with the World Health Organization. A final evaluation in 2023 indicated a significant reduction in porcine cysticercosis prevalence to 8%, while human taeniasis saw a slight decrease to 0.63%. The project evaluated alternative vaccine formulations and implemented community engagement strategies to enhance awareness and participation in vaccination programs. One of its key results is that the needs of the program triggered the development by WHO (one of the project partners) of material to facilitate the training on prevention and management of neurological adverse events during preventive. The material was validated during the project and is now available on the WHO website and the OpenWHO course on T. solium (the tapeworm). In addition, guidelines on Cysvax® vaccine are now included in the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH, formerly OIE) Terrestrial Manual. At the project's request and with project support, the Government of Madagascar created the National Animal Ethics Committee for the first time under the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Livestock. The One Health T. solium control program project has been the largest One Health T. solium control program ever implemented until now, and the first such program implemented as a public health program. It is important to note that during this research project, the research team had a car accident that resulted in the loss of a respected research team member.

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

The establishment of the National Animal Ethics Committee is a good starting point for a larger uptake and use of the evidence generated by this project. If the model developed by this project could be adopted by The Government of Madagascar, it would be worth highlighting it this report.
