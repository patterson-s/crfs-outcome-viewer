## Project Abstract

Nanobubble technology has transformed wastewater treatment industries around the world. Research into new applications for nanobubbles suggests many industries, including aquaculture, could benefit from this innovative, non-chemical disinfection technology. Small and medium size aquaculture farms in Asia struggle to reduce infectious diseases on their farms. The use of antimicrobials to control bacterial diseases has, in some cases, been abused and antimicrobial resistance associated with aquaculture practices has been documented. Finding cost-effective alternatives to using antimicrobials is essential for ensuring the sustainability of small farms in developing countries.

This project proposed to assess whether the nanobubble technology could: 1) Reduce the pathogens on a farm during a disease outbreak; 2) Improve the efficacy of vaccines; 3) Reduce the level of antibiotics in the aquatic environment during therapeutic treatments; and 4) Improve the growth rate of fish and shrimp in Asia. A series of laboratory and field experiments were conducted in Hong Kong, Vietnam and Thailand on fresh and saltwater aquatic animal pathogens to determine the effect of nanobubble technology in different types of aquaculture systems. The impact of exposure to nanobubbles on the health and growth of fish and shrimp was assessed, as well as whether this technology could reduce the level of antimicrobials detected in water after metaphylactic treatments. This project still has the potential to significantly reduce the use of antimicrobials in aquaculture. It could provide farmers with a tool to reduce exposure to pathogens on farms, improve vaccine efficacy, enhance growth without the use of antimicrobials, and bind and remove antimicrobials that leach out of medicated feed during therapeutic treatments.

Ozone nanobubbles were found to be effective at reducing bacteria in water in small to medium scale systems. The use of nanobubbles to deliver ozone reduced the time to achieve a desired ozone concentration. Since quality of water is a concern for aquaculture in LMICs, having a tool, such as the nanobubble technology, could allow aquaculture production improvements.

Ozone (delivered at a concentration of 0.15mg/L) and Oxygen nanobubbles were safe to use on fish despite the supersaturation of oxygen observed with these types of treatments. This result is important for the application of nanobubbles in commercial aquaculture farms. There are times when farmers are not able to follow strict protocols. Therefore, application of nanobubbles past oxygen saturation will not be a concern for the farmers.

Ozone nanobubbles reduced mortality during bacterial disease outbreaks in both shrimp and finfish without compromising growth. One of the main goals of this technology is to use it during outbreaks to treat infectious diseases. This will reduce the need for antimicrobial use and hence, decrease the development of antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, the technology proved to reduce production loss due to mortalities.

Ozone nanobubbles stimulated the fish's immune system prior to immersion vaccination and may enhance vaccine uptake and efficacy. Immersion vaccination is important because they reduce handling of animals. The problem is that the vaccine antigen not always reach the immune system. Improving antigen uptake by the immune system is of extreme importance for this route of vaccination.

Ozone nanobubbles could be used to improve the life span and efficiency of forward osmosis membrane filtration of water to remove drugs from the aquatic environment including antibiotics such as tetracycline. This system could reduce the use of antimicrobials in case that antimicrobial therapy is needed. It is important to be able to remove antimicrobials from water after the treatment to reduce leakage to the environment. Hence, the combination of nanobubble and osmosis membrane filtration can help remove the antimicrobial from the aquatic environment.

3. If appropriate, explain why outputs were not completed or were of poor quality.
Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

The team performed their research with high quality and diligence. The COVID-19 pandemic had a huge impact on access to the research facilities, acquisition of reagents, and local and international trips. As the project advanced some milestones were modified to correct the curse of their research and achieve the objectives and improve the outcomes. For example, the team was not able to test the effects of nanobubbles on grouper because the facilities in Hong Kong did not permit them to house saltwater fish easily. Further it was clear that this technology would not be useful for disinfection of net pens as originally hypothesized (i.e. using a bubble curtain). Instead of using this species, the team evaluated the effect of ozone nanobubbles on jade perch.

The team was not able to assess bacterial disease outbreaks under commercial conditions because they did not have equipment that could treat large ponds. Part of the problem is that when they were conducting the research there were no companies who design equipment for use in aquaculture, particularly for large ponds. However, the team tested the technology in small ponds. Additionally, the team offers the nanobubbles, for free, through the aquatic animal veterinary service of the University to any farmer who would like to try. This is having a great impact as many farmers are interested in trying the technology.

The team did not complete a full cost benefit analysis partly because the technology is evolving so quickly. When this project started there was no information and equipment designed for aquaculture. At the end of this research, the team found two companies that started to design nanobubbles for use in aquaculture. It is important to note that the results of this research had a huge influence on these companies. Therefore, their research had a strong impact on the expansion of the technology. The team created a flexible app that could adapt to the changing technology (i.e. flow rates) to inform farmers on the time and costs required for achieving different objectives. The app was made available.

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?
Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

Antimicrobial Resistance, at a global level, is a major threat to human and animal health. Antimicrobials play a critical role in treating mostly bacterial farm animal diseases. However, the high production farm systems and the non-prudent use of antimicrobials, in both human and veterinary medicine, are associated with the emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant micro-organisms (e.g. bacteria) and has been identified as a risk factor for human infectious

diseases. Alternative products to antimicrobials, such as the proposed nanobubble technology, can play a crucial role in reducing the need, and hence non-prudent use, of antimicrobials in animal agriculture (e.g. preventing infectious diseases altogether). Several bacterial and viral pathogens affect finfish and shellfish. The variety of fish produced, and the presence of multiple pathogens increase the challenge to control infectious diseases in aquaculture. These infections cause important economic losses to the aquaculture industry and raise concerns about animal welfare. There are not many commercial vaccines for freshwater finfish. Additionally, vaccines for shrimp do not work because they lack the branch of immune system targeted by vaccines.

The team has generated a wealth of data and resources through this project that scientists will be utilizing for future funding applications, to reassess the potential of vaccine candidates in challenge trials. This research contributed to several areas including molecular genetics, pathology, bioinformatics, immunology, vaccinology, and microbiology. Although the goal of the team was not to develop a vaccine, they did test the effects of the nanobubbles in antigen uptake for immersion vaccines and the possibility of increasing immune response of vaccinated animals.

This project found several practical uses for oxygen and ozone nanobubbles in aquaculture. Although the team did not develop nanobubble technology their research provides a significant amount of information on the use of this technology. The scientists evaluated nanobubbles using laboratory-based research experiments on multiple aquatic species initially, then scaled up some of their experiments to small commercial ponds. For example, their deliverables included 17 published scientific papers, 7 industry workshops, and 6 scientific presentations on the different uses of nanobubble technology in aquaculture. They also incorporated nanobubbles in the City University of Hong Kong's veterinary service for small aquaculture farmers in Hong Kong. To help farmers understand the cost of running the equipment and the number of machines they would need to either oxygenate their ponds or disinfect them the team created an app which is currently available at https://nanobubbles.shinyapps.io/nanobubble_flow/.

# 5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

The outputs above were of high quality and are commensurate to the purpose and risk level of the first phase of the project. This project generated important information that contributed to scientific knowledge in the areas of bacteriology and immunology, as well as molecular genetics and vaccinology. The knowledge acquired was presented in several conferences that reached students, PIs, and investors from the scientific community. The team also organized multiple workshops to present the technology to farmers. Contribution of this research helps advance knowledge on diverse diseases that affect finfish and shrimp. It also helps increase the understanding of the technology and its potential applications in aquaculture.

The objectives were ambitious as the team wanted to explore the use of nanobubbles in multiple fresh and saltwater species using multiple gases. The team did not meet 100% the objectives because they were not able to test all the scenarios that were initially planned. In the case where the team found that the initial hypotheses were not correct, they stopped investigations and redirected to projects that seemed more promising (i.e. use of air and O2 nanobubbles to disinfect water was abandoned after 1 year and the team focused on ozone nanobubbles). This means that some of the original objectives were slightly modified to advance the research to more feasible outcomes.

The team was not able to test all the saltwater fish species the wanted to assess because the nanobubbler did not perform well in saltwater net pens. However, to compensate, the team evaluated several novel applications of nanobubble technology in greater depth, including the mechanism by which this technology enhances fish immune response and vaccine efficacy, and its impact on uptake of bacteriophages by fish. Additionally, the team explored filtration materials for aquaculture, which had very good disinfection properties. While pursuing this line of

investigation, the team found a potential material for creating disinfection nets for open net pen farming. Also, near the end of the project, the team started exploring nanobubbles to alter the microbial community of earthen ponds. This is important because a healthy microbial community helps reduce pathogenic microbes.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?
Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.
Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy.
Provide specific numbers where possible.

This project tackled an important gap: lack of innovative technological solutions to address some of IDRC's Development Outcomes. Thus, the project laid the foundation upon which subsequent work could be built to ultimately contribute to IDRC's Development Outcomes, especially "improving health for all". This technology addresses improvement of the microenvironment and biosecurity, which contributes to the "enhancing food and nutrition security" development outcome by reducing animal losses from disease and contributing to a sustainable animal health system for the future. The reduction in AM use also contributes to the increase in food safety. Healthy animals are also more likely to adapt to climate change. Vaccines are an important tool to improve animal health, including finfish. Which positively impacts production and reduction on the use of antimicrobials. However, vaccination in fish can be cumbersome and stressful. The nanobubble technology could increase the response to vaccination, particularly of immersion vaccines. This is important for the reduction of handling and stress.

Although the team did not develop the technology, its application in aquaculture was novel. This new technology has the potential to increase animal health and reduce the need for antimicrobials. The application of the technology was not on discovery, and the team performed mostly proof-of-concept research paving the way to understand whether the nanobubble technology could be used in aquaculture. There are very few biosafety measures established in aquaculture. Since the quality of water in many countries is less than optimal, the current nanobubble technology offered to reduce this gap. Having Healthy animals improves the adaptation of aquaculture species to climate change. It also decreases the impact of infectious diseases, including morbidity and mortality, which contribute to reduced production, food waste, economic losses and decrease food security.

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

There were few problems identified during the granting process. The team had to wait for their research agreement until the governments from Vietnam and Thailand granted them country clearance. This delayed receiving funds from IDRC. However, once country clearance was obtained, all financial processes went smoothly and without any problems. The teams responded quickly and efficiently to all IDRC requests. All changes required to the budget of the project were requested by the team and approved by IDRC. The financial reports have been finalized.

The recipient from City University of Hong Kong did not spend all the budgeted money and had lapsed back a total CAD 129,326 to InnoVet-AMR. The recipient reported HKD 1,606,000, which equals the amount committed in the Grant Agreement.

The Recipient from RIA-1 spent 98.8% of the total approved budget. Due to a currency conversion deficit, the Recipient reduced the budget by 250,369,089 VND (approx. 15,700 CAD) to meet this shortfall. The Recipient committed 3,332,400,000 in contributions in the Grant Agreement but reported 6,419,950,000 VND. A total of CAD 1,468 was lapsed back to the EFP.

The recipient from Suan Sunandha Rajabhat University spent 100% of the forecasted budget. The recipient's contribution was the same as the proposed in the approved budget (26 M THB). There was CAD 4,646 on savings due to currency fluctuations.

# STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

One of the identified risks for this project was the country clearance approval from Vietnam and Thailand. The InnoVet-AMR team established processes that allowed the teams from Vietnam and Thailand to apply for country clearance in a timely manner.

Several risks were identified before the start of the project that were related to the technology. The risks identified with the technology were mitigated by developing a proper research support package that included training on technology, regulatory, intellectual property, quality assurance, marketing / commercialization, and gender. In addition, the InnoVet-AMR team hired various consultants to evaluate the projects in several aspects, including feasibility of the technology to reach market, regulatory, intellectual property, and marketing / commercialization. The consultants provided their findings and advice to the teams.

Some milestones had to be adjusted to be able to achieve the objectives. This allowed the team to succeed in their research, while investigating areas not originally planned but of great importance. This approach is common in scientific research, and it was considered as part of the technological risks.

One risk that was not originally considered was the COVID-19 pandemic, which impacted mobilization, use of the research facilities, and acquisition of reagents. This was addressed on time by providing an extension with supplement to the team. However, China kept its borders closed until 2023 affecting activities, such as training and workshops. The teams from Vietnam and particularly, from Thailand took over some of these activities minimizing the risks. Additionally, virtual meetings were organized.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

This research fulfilled all the ethical requirements. Therefore, no problems or challenges related to ethics were identified. The teams sent all the ethics approvals for the use of animals on time before any experiment was conducted.

# Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

This project was one of eleven IDRC funded projects which were developed through the Innovative Veterinary Solutions for antimicrobial resistance (InnoVet-AMR), a partnership with the UK Department of Health and Social Care (UK-DHSC). The objective of this initiative was to develop alternatives (including vaccines) to antibiotics in the veterinary sector. The project focused on the aquaculture sector which is one of the fastest growing industries and one where antibiotics are used in high quantity. The focus of the InnoVet-AMR 2.0 was to develop new products and therefore a series of training opportunities was developed by IDRC to accompany

the research teams in the product development process toward commercialization. This project was the only one using a product already in the market (nanobubblers) but testing it for a different use. The project was able to generate good results with a lot of input from the private sector. The project has also influenced the production of different types of nanobubblers more adapted to reducing the use of antibiotics in water in the aquaculture production system. The research team also generated interesting results on the positive impact of using nanobubblers when administering vaccines. Before finalizing the project and the program, a new phase has been negotiated with the UK-DHSC: InnoVet-AMR 2.0. A component of this new program will be to continue funding the projects of InnnoVet-AMR1.0 within a second phase. This project is well positioned to receive further funding in this new phase of funding.

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

The project, titled "Investigating the Use of Nanobubble Technology in Aquaculture," has produced several important outcomes for the veterinary sector. The project aimed to assess whether nanobubble technology can reduce the burden of pathogens on aquaculture farms during a disease outbreak and decrease the use of antimicrobials in the aquatic environment. This innovative approach was highly recommended during the project selection process.

This PCR exemplifies the importance of partnerships such as the Innovative Veterinary Solutions for Antimicrobial Resistance (InnoVet-AMR), a collaboration between IDRC and the UK Department of Health and Social Care (UK-DHSC). This initiative is a great example of how animal management techniques can offer alternative antibiotics in the veterinary sector. The impressive progress of this project in delivering results demonstrates the importance of partnerships that invest in new technological solutions to combat antimicrobial resistance.
