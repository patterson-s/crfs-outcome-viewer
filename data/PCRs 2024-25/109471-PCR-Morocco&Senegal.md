# Project Abstract

Consumption of fresh milk and dairy products has a key role in nutritious diets. While milk consumption in Morocco is medium on average, there is still a lot of heterogeneity in the country's value chain. In Senegal, milk consumption stagnates to values lower than 30 liters per capita per year, and this poses problems not only for the economic viability of the value chain, but also for recommended nutritional intake ensuring healthy child development. The purpose of the project is to support the development of resilient goat and cow milk value chains in Morocco and Senegal respectively. The two value chains are of central importance to women and offer great potential to improve livelihoods through greater income and improved food and nutritional security. But these value chains also present technical and development challenges as they face regional challenges such as climate change, soil degradation, rural isolation and out-migration. The project will use innovative technologies to help stimulate, grow, stabilize and promote local food systems that generate additional income, especially for women, and enhance the resilience of smallholder farmers. A participatory process will be used to design and implement a farmer centric experimentation with identified priority interventions that have the potential for transformational change across the milk value chain. Key expected results include fully mapped value chains in each case study region, a portfolio of upgrading opportunities, increased role and agency of women, the development of business models and formulation of a scaling up strategy to support widespread adoption of these models. The project will be led by the African Plant Nutrition Institute (APNI) with two implementing partners: Association Marocaine pour la Recherche-Développement, in Morocco, and Innovation, Environnement, Développement-Afrique, in Senegal.

# A. Background, Insights and Reflections

The research idea of this project emerged from the discussions (led by Marwan Owaygen and Michele Leone) related to a regional workshop which was planned to be held in Morocco on March 12 and 13/2020 (under RSP 109176), to which fourteen research institutions from six countries in North Africa (Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia) and West Africa (Mali, Niger and Senegal) were invited to present research ideas related to the upgrading of specific food value chains to enhance the resilience of smallholder farmers in rain-fed farming systems. The workshop had to be canceled at the last minute (on March 10) due to COVID's travel restrictions. It was expected to result in a closed call for proposals targeting participating institutions with projects having a common general objective, a common overall methodological framework and common development outcomes but with different value chains. The original plan was to fund six research projects, one in each of the six target countries, with a total budget of 3 million CAD (half a million CAD per project on average). This budget was reduced to one million CAD because of budget reallocation cross programs to support a Centre-wide initiative labelled as "IDRC's rapid response to COVID-19". To keep the spirit and the vision of the initial flagship and strategic project which was quite innovative in its design and in the way of linking North Africa and West Africa, it was decided to select the best research idea from each region to fund one project in North Africa and one in West Africa. Morocco and Senegal were selected with R&amp;D-Maroc (Association Marocaine pour la Recherche-Développement) and IED-Afrique (Innovation, Environnement, Développement) as respective proposant institutions.

With the first challenge (downscaling the project) surmounted, the two program officers had to face a second challenge. Senior Management (during that period) was not in favour of approving projects which are less than one million CAD. To address this second challenge, it was decided to invite the African Plant Nutrition Institute (APNI), headquartered in Morocco, to submit a concept note based on the two advanced research ideas received by IDRC from R&amp;D-Maroc and IED-Afrique (both focusing on milk value chain). With this arrangement, there will be one grant agreement with APNI (a budget of around 1 million CAD) and APNI will be then sub-contracting the two national institutions. The decision to invite APNI to lead the development of the joint proposal and to oversee project's implementation was based on its experience and capacity to manage sub-regional projects and on its research competencies in general and in value chain analysis in particular. The drawback of this arrangement (which was suggested and accepted to address an internal administrative requirement and not for being necessarily the best option for an effective project's implementation) is that IDRC will lose some of the plus in its grant+ business model as the two POs (responsible and collaborating) will not be able to interact directly (for monitoring and mentoring) with the two national implementing institutions but indirectly through APNI.

APNI set up an incubator (as the first objective of the project) to support (among others) an ad-hoc learning network mainly through four high-level value chain specialists (recruited by APNI as international consultants) based outside the two regions, in addition to APNI's project leader (based in Morocco). Throughout the project's implementation, APNI expressed to IDRC concerns about the capacity and methodological approaches of the two implementing research teams, who also seemed not to be satisfied with the

IDRC·CRDI

guidance and technical support provided by APNI. Against this challenge, substantial efforts were invested by the two POs, first for reconciliation among the three institutions and second for providing guidance to them on the way forward towards achieving expected results. All interactions were virtual as travel was restricted during most of the period of project implementation (two years from November 2020 to November 2022 + 5 months of no cost extension). I can conclude, as the responsible officer, and with a certain degree of confidence, that with the same level of efforts invested by the two POs for reconciliation, coordination, monitoring and mentoring the work on the ground (indirectly through APNI), the overall performance of the project would have been better had these efforts been invested directly with the two implementing institutions (under the same COVID-related restrictions) in the framework of two separate grant agreements with two responsible POs, one for each project. To note that the pandemic of COVID-19 hindered APNI and IDRC from conducting physical meetings and from visiting the action sites in the two countries. The only opportunity when all institutions came together in a physical meeting, including IDRC (through Michele Leone), was the cross-learning workshop which took place in Dakar at the end of January 2023, around one month before the project's closure after its extension.

## This background triggers two reflections:

1. The first is in relation to IDRC’s initiative “rapid response to COVID-19”. Budget reallocation to support this initiative downscaled the project originally designed to be a flagship one. There are merits to evaluate this Centre-wide initiative, taking into consideration the resulting opportunity costs that occurred in programs. The evaluation should be also undertaken against some skepticism about the added value of this initiative, about the comparative advantage of the Centre in addressing the crisis of COVID-19 pandemic, and about the alignment of this initiative with programs’ priorities. What is important is not the evaluation of the initiative per se, but rather the lessons learned from it which are expected to contribute to guiding future decision-making processes in the Centre about investing or not in response to emerging crises outside the scope of Strategy 2020-2030.

2. The second reflection is in relation to the policy/practice/trend in the Centre of supporting large projects (with a budget of one million CAD and above) rather than small/medium projects (less than one million). One of the perceived rationales is that large projects ease administrative burdens. This project is an illustrative example against this perception, and it can be used in a potential (and I think needed) Centre-wide evaluation of the impact of supporting large projects (above one million CAD) in a cost-benefit analysis framework. It will be also important in this framework to question the perception that larger projects result in larger impacts.

## B. Important Results

## MOROCCO:

1. Designing and piloting solutions to upgrade the goat milk value chain in Rhamna:

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC·CRDI

The project in Morocco focused on designing and piloting solutions to some of the key challenges facing the nascent goat milk value chain in the province of Rhamna. In this province, the government supported the creation of five women-led cooperatives to produce goat milk in addition to one processing cooperative. Given its agro-climatic conditions, the province of Rhamna is under severe threat of desertification and conventional grazing system is an aggravating factor of land degradation. Low green fodder production is one of the limiting factors to the development of the goat milk value chain. Milk production is erratic, and the regularity of providing milk to processors is uncertain.

The following interventions were piloted in one of the five goat milk production cooperatives:

- With respect to fodder production:

The project piloted an agroforestry system with atriplex in combination with annual crops (legumes and cereals), irrigated forages (blue panicum, barley, forage corn, berseem and sorghum) and barley hydroponics. The latter allowed the production of 500 kg/day of green fodder. The irrigated blue panicum and sorghum produced 100 tons/year of fresh matter.

- With respect to herd's composition and management:

Upgrading interventions included introduction and crossing with pure dairy breeds, adoption of feed rations complying with dairy goat standards, adequate layout of goat sheds and adoption of best practices of hygiene and production. These upgrading interventions allowed women farmers to increase milk production from 0.3 liter to 2 liters/day/goat.

## 2. Informing and guiding future government-funded investments:

Morocco’s development strategy for the agricultural sector (Green Generation 2020-2030) focuses on enhancing the involvement of rural women in formal economic activities. The five dairy cooperatives in the province of Rhamna were created in 2019 with the support of the government through the Provincial Directorate of Agriculture (DPA). Despite these cooperatives are firmly supported financially and technically by government agencies, the nascent goat milk value chain is facing significant challenges at its different nodes, particularly at the production node.

The active engagement of government agencies (mainly DPA¹, ONSSA², and ONCA³) in project implementation and the created synergy made this project a model of collaboration between researchers, local communities and government agencies. The robust value chain approach adopted by the project to understand bottlenecks, design solutions, pilot them and demonstrate their impact presents a better and more convincing bottom-up approach than the conventional “Filière” top-down approach followed by the government. The project

equipped government agencies with the needed knowledge generated from the diagnosis and piloting phases to guide future government-funded investments aiming at better integrating rural women into economic activities.

# SENEGAL:

## 3. Detailed diagnosis of the cow milk value chain in Ferlo region:

This diagnosis included mapping of territorial actors, analysis of interactions between actors, analysis of the economic performance of the sector, analysis of the political and legal framework and market studies. It revealed the following key findings:

- Irregularity in the availability of livestock feed:

The most important element is the availability of water in a semi-arid zone. Fodder resources dwindle in the dry season (9 out of 12 months) while the rainy season is a period of abundance due to the revegetation of natural pastures.

- Difficulties in marketing milk production:

Significant production losses were recorded during the period of abundance due to the saturation of the local market. Only 12% of the actors have circuits allowing them to market their products outside the locality.

- Absence of a national authority for regulating markets and organizing the sector:

Despite the place it occupies in the national economy, the milk sector is lagging far behind in setting up an organization that can serve as a consultation and regulatory framework bringing together professionals in the sector.

- Weak structuring and formalization of interactions between value chain’s actors.

- Vulnerability of women (who dominate the value chain) due to an inequitable distribution of production resources and value between the different links.

- Need to improve the competitiveness of local dairy products against imported ones, in particular powdered milk.

## 4. Upgrading APAFIL to APAFIL+:

The role of APAFIL (Association Professionnelle des Acteurs de la Filière Lait Local) was clarified. Through a series of activities, including stakeholder workshops, IED-Afrique provided clarity on the role of APAFIL. A characterisation exercise was conducted to better understand how the organization currently operates, its capacity, mandate, and other key

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC·CRDI

aspects. Based on the results of the diagnostic sessions, measures were proposed to upgrade APAFIL to APAFIL+, first operating at the regional level and then scaling to national level.

# 5. Recommending the establishment of an interprofessional organization:

The establishment of an interprofessional organization of the milk sector, driven by the State of Senegal, is necessary for a better structuring of the sector by improving socioeconomic relations between the different professions in the value chain and facilitating their "formalization". It will also respond to the challenge of improving the competitiveness of local milk products by regularizing the market (supply management, setting prices, compliance with standards, improving quality, competition) but also in defending the local milk sector against imported products, especially milk powder. This would require the creation of an inclusive steering committee whose mission will be the adoption of an action plan for the establishment of the interprofessional organization. This committee will be made up of representatives of all local umbrella organizations, industrial structures, as well as supply chain actors and state agencies.

# RESEARCH OUTPUTS

2. List up to 10 most important research outputs generated by the project. Where possible, provide the link.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC·CRDI

This research project explored how to enhance the resilience of smallholder farmers by upgrading milk value chains. In Morocco, the project focused on piloting upgrading interventions to address key challenges facing the nascent goat milk value chain supported by the government with the aim to equip government agencies with the needed knowledge to guide future government-funded investments and better integrate rural women into economic activities. In Senegal, the project focused on bringing together the actors from different levels to improve women agency and inclusion.

5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?
Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

In Senegal, the project focused on the diagnosis of the cow milk value chain, on upgrading an existing structure in this chain and on recommending the establishment of a new structure at national level. The intended piloting of some upgrading interventions/solutions (such as production of maralfalfa) did not take place because of time and budget limitations as explained by IED-Afrique.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic/core objectives?
Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.
Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project was developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

The project was funded by Agriculture and Food Security Program (AFS) in 2015-2020 Strategic Plan. Its focus on increasing the agency of women as key actors of the nodes of the milk value chain contributed to IDRC's priorities on gender and equity. Milk value chains are a key component of food systems and nutrition of rural populations in North and West Africa. The knowledge generated by the project aimed to upgrade milk value chains to enhance resilience and food security. The project is consistent with AFS goal of supporting new knowledge and innovations that lead to scalable food security solutions for the poor. The project is a direct contribution to IDRC's strategic objective 1 "invest in knowledge and innovation for large scale positive change".

## FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

As mentioned earlier in the section "Background, Insights and Reflections", Senior Management (in the period of project's approval) was not in favour of approving projects which are less than one million CAD. To address this challenge, it was decided to invite a third institution (APNI) to submit a concept note based on the two advanced research ideas received by IDRC from the two national implementing institutions. With this arrangement,

--- Page 9 ---

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC·CRDI

there will be one grant agreement (with a budget of around one million CAD) with the third institution which will be then sub-contracting the two implementing institutions. This arrangement was made to address an internal administrative requirement and not for being necessarily the best option for an effective project’s implementation.

It should be also noted that after signing the grant agreement with APNI, the institution highlighted to IDRC that in the process of sub-contracting IED-Afrique, it was revealed that there will be a tax (up to 30%) on bank transfers from Morocco to Senegal. This would affect significantly the budget of IED-Afrique. In consultation with GAD, it was suggested to transfer the budget allocated to Senegal by APNI (305000 CAD) through a grant agreement with IED-Afrique after amending the agreement with APNI. The reporting arrangement remains unchanged (i.e. APNI consolidates the technical reports from the two implementing institutions and submits the consolidated report to IDRC).

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

The PAD highlighted a medium risk that R&amp;D-Maroc and IED-Afrique may still disagree on how to proceed on the methodological front. This risk has been already attenuated by the investment made prior to the submission of the full proposal to sort out the methodology of the project. The PAD outlined the following mitigation strategy: “a close monitoring and mentoring by IDRC’s responsible and collaborating officers will reduce this risk further. The possibility of regular physical meetings in Senegal between IDRC’s collaborating officer based in WARO and IED-Afrique as well as in Morocco between APNI and R&amp;D-Maroc (both institutions are based in Morocco) will help address potential challenges in the implementation of the project”. Unfortunately, no physical meetings took place between IDRC, APNI, R&amp;D-Maroc and IED-Afrique during project’s implementation due to the restrictions associated with COVID-19. The only opportunity for a physical meeting among the four institutions was in the cross-learning workshop which took place in Dakar end of January 2023. This was about one month before the closure of the project.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

Nothing in particular.

## Program Leader / Manager comments

Program Leaders/Managers should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

I welcome Marwan’s honest reflections on the situation and strategic decisions leading up to this project. We will and have recently given these kinds of considerations to recent investments in initiative with clusters of projects. They continue to be relevant considerations as design programming in the context of rapidly changing global funding for ODA and the ongoing risks of shocks, whether they be pandemics, climate/environment, or economic shocks.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

The outputs and outcomes of the project seem to have been significantly limited by the intervening pandemic, the administrative arrangements of the project and the inability to closely monitor the projects in-country.

Morocco had interesting and important outcomes and learning in terms of an inclusive approach to understanding the challenges in the value chain and informing government strategy and investments. However, we still don't know the outcomes in terms of food security and nutrition, especially with respect to reaching low income, at-risk consumers, especially children, as this was the initial motivation for a focus on this value chain. Even if production increase was maintained, is there greater access, affordability and consumption of goat milk among the targeted consumers?

In Senegal the project generated limited useful policy-relevant learning which was probably all the more important at time when sector was vulnerable and lacking resilience while the country was also in transition and yet to turn the corner out of the pandemic toward a more pro-active and strategic investment in agri-food systems.

For reasons Marwan outlines, the project seems not have been part of a coherent cluster of projects from which synthesisable, consolidation of results can be drawn. This was limited also by the reduction in funds available for such a cluster. Never the less, like many others projects, there remains the potential to follow-up with a minimal effort to learn whether longer term impacts have led from these investments.

Pierre D. KADET, CRSF Director – August 1, 2025

Despite context-induced challenges (COVID-19 pandemic), the team demonstrated agility in revisiting and adapting the initial to land on a realistic and relevant initiative. This initiative has generated good insights that have the potential to inform future initiatives both in Morocco and Senegal. These insights and achievements include, in:

## Morrocco

- The development of a stable and increased fodder production, supported by irrigated-production systems
- The structuration of an inclusive dairy value chain through establishment of six cooperatives (five for milk production and one for mil processing)
- Enabling climate adaptation and resilience with irrigation
- Stimulating active government agencies' engagement which represents a gage of ownership and a pathway to sustainability and upscale of the project findings and recommendations

## Senegal:

- Identification of several weaknesses in the Senegal cow milk value chain that can inform future government interventions in the dairy production and processing industry: two sectors with high potential for women economic empowerment and climate change adaptation.

Internally, the team has stressed several strategic decisions that would be worth revisiting in terms of individual research projects' minimum amount and process for strategic decisions in exceptional situations like COVID-19 pandemic
