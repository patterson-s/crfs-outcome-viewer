# Project Abstract

Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia (CBPP), caused by Mycoplasma mycoides mycoides, is an important disease of cattle in sub-Saharan Africa, causing losses estimated at USD $48.6 million annually. The disease is controlled mainly using a commercially available live attenuated vaccine (T1/44). Unfortunately, this vaccine does not provide long lasting immunity, it induces adverse side effects, and requires cold chain management to maintain efficacy, which makes its delivery to smallholder livestock farmers challenging. A safer and more efficacious vaccine will enhance livelihoods and contribute to economic development in sub-Saharan countries.

As part of the Canadian International Food Security Research Fund (CIFSRF), IDRC and Global Affairs Canada funded the development of a novel CBPP vaccine using reverse vaccinology. The vaccine contains four subunit proteins formulated with the commercial adjuvant Montanide™. Preliminary studies were promising and suggested that the subunit vaccine could be more effective and safer than the current T1/44 vaccine. However, while the research team made significant progress towards developing the CBPP subunit vaccine, they did not provide sufficient information on the protective capacity of the vaccine, largely due to inability to experimentally reproduce the disease. This technical drawback withheld a final verdict on whether the new recombinant vaccine is a viable and effective vaccine to replace the current CBPP vaccine.

The objective of this project was to achieve robust experimental evidence that the protective efficacy of the subunit recombinant vaccine is better than the live attenuated CBPP vaccine T1/44. The project established and used a novel experimental infection model to demonstrate proof of concept that meets scientific and statistical thresholds. The proposed project protected the gains of one of the CIFSRF vaccine projects, leveraged LVIF's capacity to improve the quality of vaccine development in Kenya, and provided justification for further development and commercialization activities for the vaccine. This project was a partnership between VIDO-InterVac at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization and the International Livestock Research Institute in Nairobi, Kenya.

# PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

1. Development of a Novel Subunit Vaccine for CBPP.

A recombinant subunit vaccine composed of four Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides (Mmm) proteins was formulated with Montanide™ ISA61VG. It demonstrated ~52% protective efficacy (IM route), comparable to the existing live vaccine (Contavax™), but with significantly improved safety, stability, and DIVA capability (Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals).

Innovation: Unlike live vaccines, this subunit vaccine:

- Does not require a strict cold chain.
- Can be used alongside antibiotics.
- Has no risk of reversion to virulence.
- Enables better quality control and traceability.

2. Introduction of a new aerosol-based challenge model using a nebulizer.

A novel, reproducible infection model using nebulized Mmm to simulate natural infection was developed by the research team. It was the first time such a model had been used and it creates a more accurate and easier method for testing Mycoplasma candidate vaccines for the global vaccine development research community. The model achieved an 87.5% infection rate in non-vaccinated cattle, overcoming the limitations of the traditional intubation model.

Innovations:

- Portable, affordable, and easy to train for use in low- and middle-income countries.
- More consistent and realistic disease reproduction.
- Potentially adaptable to other respiratory diseases like Contagious Covine Pleural-pneumonia.

3. Demonstration of equivalent efficacy compared to Contavax™.

The intramuscularly administered subunit vaccine showed ~52% efficacy, not significantly higher than Contavax™ (~51%) using the modified Hudson-Turner scoring system. This result validates the subunit vaccine as a viable alternative to the live vaccine, especially in outbreak scenarios or export-sensitive contexts.

Innovation: The subunit vaccine offers a safer, more flexible tool for CBPP control, especially where antibiotic use is necessary or live vaccines are restricted.

4. Capacity building and technology transfer

This project strengthened institutional capacity at KALRO and ILRI through:

- Establishment of a small-scale vaccine production and testing lab at KALRO, Kenya.
- Training in nebulizer challenge models and laboratory diagnostics.

- Hiring and retention of trained personnel.
The development enhances Kenya's long-term ability to develop, test, and produce veterinary vaccines.
Innovation: Created a sustainable platform for future vaccine development and trials in the region.

# 5. Advancement toward commercialization and regulatory readiness

The research work initiated steps toward industrial-scale production and regulatory approval. Additionally, it used animal product-free media and GMP-aligned processes. There was also engaged with the Transforming Animal Health Solutions And Services In Low- And Middle-Income Countries (TAHSSL) and a vaccine commercialisation consultant, ExcelVet, for product registration planning. This positioned the vaccine for future market entry under East African Community (EAC) guidelines.
Innovation: Early alignment with regulatory and commercial pathways ensures smoother transition from research to real-world impact.

# RESEARCH OUTPUTS

2. List up to 10 most important research outputs generated by the project. Where possible, provide the link.

There was a planned publication with title "The efficacy data from the trial, including the description of the new nebulizer challenge model for CBPP", was being prepared for a scientific publication. The target submission date for this publication was June 30, 2023 but at the time of writing this PCR (2025), it had not been published. The reason was given by the team as "We had to address results which vary between vaccinated and control, including animals in the nebulizer trials. We therefore had to wait for histopathology. Now we are almost ready to submit the nebulizer manuscript and continue working on the vaccine one."

3. If appropriate, explain why outputs were not completed or were of poor quality.

Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

As explained by the team, results of the nebuliser experiment showed inconsistent data and they had to wait for biopsy samples to be processed and analysed. This delayed the publication of the research results.

Concerning the lack of a significantly higher efficacy compared to the current vaccine, it could be due to the fact that the new infection model was intentionally designed to ensure consistent disease reproduction, but it may have amplified disease severity, narrowing the efficacy gap between vaccines.

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?
Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

a. The project employed reverse vaccinology to identify key proteins of *Mycoplasma mycoides* subsp. *mycoides* (Mmm) and developed a novel subunit vaccine prototype. This approach represented an innovative strategy in CBPP vaccine development, potentially addressing limitations of current live attenuated vaccines.

b. The project aimed to overcome limitations in disease control measures for CBPP, including short-lasting immunity, cold chain requirements, and adverse reactions associated with vaccines like Contavax™. It contributed to improving disease control strategies by developing a safer, more efficacious, and stable vaccine, thereby enhancing animal welfare and reducing economic losses. If successful in the future, this would be a significant breakthrough for smallholder livestock farmers

c. The project introduced a novel aerosol-based challenge model to improve infection rates and establish reliable assessment criteria for CBPP candidate vaccine efficacy. This methodological advancement enhanced the accuracy of vaccine efficacy assessment and contributed to refining research techniques in the field.

d. The project was a collaboration between Kenyan and Canadian partners, leveraging expertise and resources from both regions. It resulted in capacity-building activities like knowledge transfer, skill development, and infrastructure enhancement (avaccine production and testing lab), which strengthened research capabilities in Kenya and the region.

5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?
Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

a. There was an expectation that the new vaccine would be significantly better in efficacy than the current one. For the smallholder farmers, introducing a new vaccine that has the same efficacy as one they are already using is a great challenge unless the safety factor can be marketed aggressively. This in a way was a disappointing outcome of the project.

b. Secondly, it was noted that the route of administration that gave a better result of the two tested was the intramuscular route. This is a cumbersome route to use for vaccinations. In an on-station trial, the protective efficacy of the recombinant vaccine was evaluated and showed approximately 52% protection when administered intramuscularly and 28% protection when administered subcutaneously.

c. There was also the unexpected impact of the Covid lockdowns that delayed the completion of this project by about 12 months. An extension was granted to mitigate this.

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective?
Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

The COVID-19 pandemic proved to be an unexpected risk; thus, the team made every effort to work remotely when it was feasible and switched to developing their implementation methods in the first year of the pandemic when field work was not feasible. They were able to finish the tasks and reach the goals thanks to two extensions from IDRC.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

The study protocol included pre-set criteria for humane intervention, meaning cattle that developed severe clinical conditions were euthanized early to prevent unnecessary suffering. This approach was used as a surrogate for mortality, acknowledging that animals reaching Humane Intervention Point (HIP) could survive longer in field conditions but were ethically removed from the study.

The Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary Medicines (GALVmed), a renown livestock research NGO, was appointed as the independent study monitor. They reviewed all records and scoring and discussed the interpretation of results with the team. This approach added credibility to the analysis and interpretation of the results. However, there was some disagreement between the interpretation of the results between GALVmed and the research team.

This project was funded through the Livestock Vaccine Innovation Fund (LVIF), which was co-funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), Global Affairs Canada (GAC) and IDRC. The fund was a 57$ CAD partnership of 8 years. It ended in March 2024. LVIF adopted a strategic model that intervened at key entry points in the vaccine development, production, and access continuum. The Fund carried out research activities along three broad streams: cutting-edge vaccine development, vaccine improvement and manufacturing, and vaccine demand, access, and use. This project was funded first through the Canadian International Food Security Research Fund (CIFSRF) implemented at IDRC. IDRC and Global Affairs Canada funded the development of a novel CBPP vaccine using reverse vaccinology. Preliminary studies were promising and suggested that the subunit vaccine could be more effective and safer than

the current T1/44 vaccine. However, while the research team made significant progress towards developing the CBPP subunit vaccine, they did not provide sufficient information on the protective capacity of the vaccine, largely due to inability to experimentally reproduce the disease. This technical drawback withheld a final verdict on whether the new recombinant vaccine is a viable and effective vaccine to replace the current CBPP vaccine.

It was then decided to fund the continuation of this project through LVIF. The new project involved collaboration between VIDO-InterVac at the University of Saskatchewan, the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization, and the International Livestock Research Institute in Nairobi. The new vaccine, developed using reverse vaccinology, showed again promising preliminary results but faced challenges in experimentally reproducing the disease to fully validate its efficacy. Despite these challenges, the project made significant progress, including the development of a new infection model, production process improvements, and capacity building in Kenya. IDRC collaborated with GALVmed to have an external evaluator for the data analysis and the conclusions reached by GALVmed and the research project were not similar. IDRC attended a final meeting at VIDO to discuss the results (Gates Foundation was also present) and we decided not to continue funding this project however the research team at VIDO mentioned that they would pursue the commercialization of this vaccine. The Gates Foundation was also not interested to pursue funding this project.
