# Project Abstract

Women smallholder livestock farmers are hindered in livestock vaccine acquisition and use due to low levels of awareness, high acquisition costs, accessibility, and unequal gender relations at household level. As a result of these barriers, women's sources of livelihood become endangered when their stock are attacked by diseases like Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) for small ruminants and Newcastle disease (ND) for poultry. This project will focus on ND and PPR vaccines in Kenya with the aim of strengthening women's economic empowerment by increasing their asset base and purchasing power and improve household food and nutrition security. The project will work with existing women's groups and cooperatives that will be empowered through knowledge of diseases, benefits of vaccines, financial and market analysis training, access to vaccines, and access to animal health services and markets through leveraging group dynamics. This study seeks to: 1) increase women's participation in the livestock vaccine distribution chain; and 2) transform gender, social and cultural norms and practices to reduce barriers to women's participation. It focuses on poultry and small ruminants, which are important for women's economic empowerment through incremental accumulation of resources which, in turn, would allow them to purchase and own small ruminants or higher value species. The project uses an experimental design with six intervention arms to test whether adding technical and gender educational components to vaccine delivery can address gender based constraints and social norms that prevent women from accessing, using and benefiting from livestock vaccines as well as address vaccine awareness and access.

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

i. Farmer empowerment: Increased awareness, knowledge and accessibility of Newcastle disease (ND) vaccines through targeted project intervention activities has triggered uptake of the vaccines among smallholder chicken farmers in project sites where many had previously never vaccinated their. Vaccination rates for ND nearly doubled from 33% to 64%. Farmers were reporting better health, reduced mortality and increased productivity of their flocks, with notable improvements in chicken husbandry practices.

ii. Some evidence of behaviour change around gender norms: Stakeholder engagements and community dialogues around norms and practices that affect women participation and engagement in the poultry vaccine value chain led to small changes indicating the community's acceptance and support of women's engagement as chicken vaccinators and players in the vaccine distribution chain that was previously exclusively male dominated. Village opinion shapers in the community also worked closely with community vaccinators making it possible for both the women and men community vaccinators to work with chicken rearing households to provide vaccinations.

iii. Collective action: Following the training on collective action, some farmers joined cooperatives or groups and there was evidence of benefits ranging from better prices for their chicken, prompt payment and fewer transactions. Women poultry farmers especially benefited with collective power to eliminate the middlemen and directly bargain for better prices of their products, as well as aggregating for NCD vaccinations and groups trainings. There were reports of men encouraging women to take up leadership opportunities in groups and cooperatives. Strengthened internal capacity of groups and co-operatives is evident in participation in group activities, shared information among members, emphasize on strategic planning and common vision, holding regular meetings and keeping of requisite records.

iv. Changing household nutrition patterns: As a result of the nutrition training some families are planning meals, increasing food variety including own-produced eggs and chicken and other animal source foods (ASFs), as opposed to selling all that they produce. The increased consumption of ASF could also be attributed to increased flock productivity following project intervention.

v. Strengthened partnerships: The project interventions facilitated the formation and strengthening of important relations and partnerships between farmers and agrovet dealers, veterinarians, local administrators, community based organizations, county cooperative officers, county gender and social services officers, county veterinary services officers, county nutrition officers, private players, the research team among others – all of which are instrumental in the sustainability of the activities. Smallholder farmers and their organizations have built relationships and links with strategic actors (such as co-operative officers and government officers responsible for group activities, government officers input providers, political leaders etc.) who they can contact regarding husbandry practices, inputs such as vaccines, markets, conflict resolution and adherence to legal and administrative requirements.

## 3. If appropriate, explain why outputs were not completed or were of poor quality.

Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

Several of the project outputs were of poor quality. The training material was weak on gender integration. Within the cohort of projects, this team was the weakest in terms of their research and implementation on gender equality and women's empowerment. On the upside, being part of the cohort was a huge support to this team and presented a lot of opportunities for growth of the PIs and team members. This team was much stronger on the ground and in their applied work and had a long and strong history working with the county.

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

## 4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

Click here to enter text.

This research addressed a critical area of need for smallholder farmers especially women for whom chicken and goat production are sources of livelihood in marginal agricultural lands where crop agriculture is not feasible. Newcastle disease (ND) and Contagious Caprine Pleuropneumonia (CPP) cause high mortality impact farmer incomes and livelihoods. While vaccines for the control of these diseases are available, access and use remain low.

The findings add to the body of knowledge on the dynamics of women empowerment within a resource constrained settings where outcomes of interventions are complex and not easily discernable in the short-term. Their study shows that women empowerment programs and projects must be multipronged, long-term and anchored in local development policy and programs in order for them to deliver long term empowerment benefits to women.

Key Scientific contributions:

- The project has generated new knowledge and information on challenges, barriers and opportunities in women empowerment, poultry vaccine supply chain and collective action. Limited knowledge of vaccines and vaccine availability (including distance to provider) contributed to low ND vaccine uptake, and rates of uptake of CCPP vaccine were found to be positively associated with the level of education of the head of household. Perception of the effectiveness of ND vaccine were very strongly associated with uptake, while a reliance on herbal remedies was found to be common in the study area and contribute to low uptake.

- Livestock production and small animal husbandry tasks are mostly performed by women, while men perform tasks that put them in control of important production and financial decisions. Inequitable power relations and skewed access to resources in favour of men were identified as obstacles to women's participation in poultry and small ruminant production and to women scaling up their production and investing in commercialization.

- The study contributes to the growing field of methodologies and tools that measure women's empowerment. They applied the Women empowerment in Livestock index (WELI) and generated data that can be used to compare with other similar studies in resource constrained settings. The results of their study showed women as being more empowered than men in majority of the domains, contrary to the expectation and findings by other studies. It raises interesting research questions that may be of interest to gender scholars and researchers and perhaps contribute to further refinements of the tools.

- Through training, awareness creation, stakeholder engagement, and various vaccine delivery models, the project demonstrated the effectiveness of ND vaccines in curbing chicken ND related deaths in a region where use of vaccines was very low. This encouraged vaccine uptake among chicken farmers and increased productivity. With continued county government support, vaccine use is likely to continue expanding.

Climate Adaptation Linkages:

Their study provides important lessons and experiences in the structure and organization of poultry vaccine supply chain in LMICs and in particular in remote and marginalised areas where the service is critical but lacking. They tested two vaccine delivery models, the demand driven model and the community vaccinator driven model. Their results show that both models delivered the benefits of increased flock productivity and empowerment of women but also magnified the issue of sustainability of these benefits. Their study area is characterised by chronic poverty and frequent and increasingly severe climate-change related disasters, predominantly drought. Without intense and sustained mitigation measures, these challenges can easily push back project gains leaving farmers in a perpetual cycle of poverty.

Initially, the project noted an increase in flock numbers after interventions, which triggered an increased demand for vaccines and generating a positive market signal. In the last year of intervention, the area experienced severe drought and many families sold off their chickens to cope with the severe effects of drought. Consequently, the vaccination services and the vaccination supply chain were becoming redundant. These findings raise important issues and questions on sustainability of vaccine and vaccination services for smallholder farmers in marginal areas and in a changing climate.

Potential for scaling impact:

Through training and a series of engagements with both men and women farmers, the project documented the acceptance of the role of women in vaccine distribution in the

IDRC·CRDI

community, a previously male role. After interventions with consistent messaging and continuous engagement with stakeholders, the project demonstrated that livestock farmers will accept women as vaccinators provided the services offered are of high quality.

After testing different vaccine delivery modes, the project established that the use of peer community vaccinators (CVs) in the distribution and delivery of ND vaccines in remote areas is viable, however should be done with close supervision of trained animal health assistants or veterinarians. It evident that the CVs were not able to effectively perform the peer education role as envisaged in the project since farmers inquired about a wide range of livestock problems covering different species which required a higher level of expertise and knowledge beyond the CVs scope. The project deemed it important that the role of peer education be left to trained animal health specialists, AHSPs who are certified, or CVs who work under close supervision.

In Makueni County where the project took place, there are very few AHSPs and extension services, so there may be no choice but to use CVs. Many NGOs in Makueni trained CVs informally with no standardization. Some kind of CV accreditation and extensive training is therefore needed. The project has been working with the county to get a streamlined and formalized system of training and accrediting the CVs and with the Kenya Veterinary Board to allow them to work with CVs under certain conditions, based on project findings.

As a result of this project:

- A decline in ND related chicken deaths because of increased uptake of ND vaccines.
- Increased interest in chicken production among farmers and groups. E.g. farmers reported selling goats and used proceeds from the sale to build improved chicken houses. This is contrary to the norm where farmers sell goats for high-cost emergencies like medical bills and school fees etc.
- Farmers putting into practice knowledge gained from training like routine chicken vaccination against ND, regular cleaning of the chicken house, synchronized hatching, selecting eggs for hatching, daily cleaning of watering equipment among other husbandry practices.
- Gradual shift from individual to collective marketing of chicken was evident among smallholder farmers upon the realization of benefiting from better prices and prompt payment that come with collective marketing.
- Increased demand for improved breeds of chicken as farmers increasingly see the viability of poultry production in increasing household incomes.

The length of this PCR section will testify to the fact that projects with a gender-transformative ambition using mixed-methods are complex and benefit considerably from a strong relationship with the IDRC responsible officer and from participating in a cohort in order to adapt to situational challenges, achieve results and generate important lessons.

The team lacked a strong gender analytical framework from the start remained for the most part gender responsive rather than gender transformative. The project included only limited engagement with the community on the gender norms driving the inequalities and little to no interventions aimed at challenging these root norms. The team received ongoing support from the Responsible Officer and other teams in the cohort to strengthen their tools and approaches and as a result the team did make changes along the way, but in a 4-year project, with significant time lost due to the pandemic, the changes were modest. The lead PI, the key team member with gender expertise, seemed to spend little time engaged in the project as she was

continually pulled into administrative duties at the university. There was an overreliance on graduate students who lacked the close supervision and guidance necessary for the gender transformative changes they sought. The team also did not have the necessary pedagogical experience to work on the training materials. Despite receiving early advice to bring in other experts to help them develop the materials, the team developed them mainly through their students. The poor quality of the resulting materials is evident.

The use of CVs as peer educators was not as effective as anticipated. This is because farmers had many questions and needed a different level of support that could only be addressed by trained veterinarian or animal health experts. Despite this, the intervention phase went on as planned and the only adjustment made was to allow all the CVs to contact veterinarians should these situations arise.

The project expected a gradual increase in chicken holdings after each round of ND vaccination, but prolonged drought reduced the availability of chicken feed and affected production. This discouraged many farmers from increasing their flock while others sold off their poultry. Their original target of vaccinating up to 700,000 chicken was affected, resulting in the project's decision to scale the vaccination exercise to other neighbouring villages. Drought notwithstanding, the project expected farmers to gradually move up the livestock ladder by selling chickens to purchase larger livestock, however, the contrary was evident in some households as small ruminants were sold off to finance the construction of chicken houses or scale up poultry production. This could be due to increased interest triggered by the training and the beneficial impacts of the ND vaccinations.

While the project had intended to have 10 newly formed cooperatives, corruption and political interference in some cooperatives resulted in distrust among communities. As well, lack of funds for registration and monthly subscriptions, little or no interest owing to past experiences and competing interests at the community level affected membership. As a result, the project managed to form only 2 new cooperatives, strengthen 2 existing ones and in some areas worked with existing groups to enhance the distribution of vaccines within the study area. This affected their original plan to mobilize, campaign and vaccinate chicken through formally registered need-based cooperatives/groups. The project found evidence that social networks are stronger among the informal collectives vs formal, and observed informal groups were easier to bring on board. Women's groups mobilized themselves much more efficiently and effectively for vaccination and training.

COVID-19 greatly impacted (halted) all field related activities in Kenya for the year 2020 due to government shutdowns, movement restrictions and curfews. The team was nearly a behind in implementation of activities. To mitigate, they reverted to virtual meetings and discussions where possible including sessions of write shops for the preparation of manuscripts and telephone surveys with participants. IDRC granted all 4 projects in the cohort, including this one, a 12-month extension to March 2023 to enabling them to complete activities as planned. This team also supported the COVID-19 response efforts (providing masks, soap, PPE) to mitigate impact in the communities where they are engaged.

The Women's Empowerment in Livestock Index (WELI) was a common tool that IDRC asked the cohort of 4 LVIF women's empowerment projects to adopt to create the possibility of meta-analysis for stronger data and greater impact of findings on women's empowerment. Under another CRFS project (RSP 109786), the CGIAR Gender Platform (lead by ILRI) has been contracted to synthesize IDRC's use of Women's Empowerment Indicators, drawing on the experiences from the 12 IDRC projects (8 from CultiAF and 4 from LVIF). However, the WELI is more of a pilot tool, requiring more resources than anticipated and all the LVIF teams had difficulty cleaning and analyzing their baseline data. It took much more resources than anticipated (time and budgeted), and all 4 LVIF teams ended up hiring biostatisticians to support this work.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.
Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

The project contributes to IDRC outcomes on gender equality by facilitating women's empowerment through training and access to resources and focuses on the prevention of emerging infectious diseases and zoonotic disease, leading to improved livestock health and productivity. It also enhances women's economic empowerment and leadership. The project is also well aligned with the CRFS (and IDRC's) gender strategy on promoting gender-transformative approaches with a high potential to change existing gender norms towards gender equality. The contributions towards this outcome were highlighted through the final dissemination activities that took place at Women Deliver 2023 in Kigali, an important global forum for advancing gender equality.

Impact at scale: The project took place in Makueni County and worked directly with the county government who strongly supported the project. The project was expected to benefit at least 1,200 women smallholder farmers and their families, and has reached many more (2,802 households reached on average in each chicken vaccination cycle and 886 households for each goat vaccination cycle; 4 cooperatives totalling 2,000 members were formed; 626 farmers, 124 community vaccinators, and 221 cooperative and group leaders were trained) and it is expected to reach more at national scales given the interventions are working with several government departments and extension, vaccine distributors and agri-dealers. The county is a major supplier indigenous chicken to Nairobi and other parts of Kenya, and the findings have the potential to be used in other counties where women control a substantial number of chicken and small ruminants.

Building leaders for today and tomorrow: The project placed a significant emphasis on the inclusion of early career researchers, including six master's students and 11 junior researchers. The project built community leaders by training women and men as community vaccinators and peer educators, and women cooperatives in leadership and entrepreneurship. Trainings also covered aspects of gender and social norms, including gender-based violence.

Partner of Choice: The project was funded through LVIF, a donor-partnership program comprising IDRC, Global Affairs Canada, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

## FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

Click here to enter text.

The flexibility in IDRC granting allowed them extensions was critical as the team lost nearly a full year as a result of the pandemic. The second extension enabled them to take advantage of the major Women Deliver Conference in Kigali in July 2023 to disseminate their findings at a side event, alongside the other projects in the cohort.

Regular monthly check-in meetings with IDRC were critical to give immediate feedback rather than waiting at the end of the reporting period. This project in particular, as detailed above, particularly benefited and was strengthened by being part of a cohort with other similar LVIF projects.

IDRC·CRDI

## The cohort model

As this project was one among four that responded to an LVIF call for proposals on addressing dimensions of gender inequalities and barriers in the LVVC, and with similar start and end times, the Responsible Officer brought the cohort together at regular intervals to exchange and share learnings with high turnout. The goal was to build a body of evidence and comparable results that can have greater impact and policy influence and create opportunities for joint capacity building. It also fostered deeper shared learning, stimulated peer-to-peer exchanges, cross-project learning and collaboration across countries and projects. Feedback from the teams indicated it was a value add to their projects and a positive experience. All the projects adapted, clarified, and strengthened their methodologies through their participation in the cohort, and collaborating on advocacy contributed to stronger impacts. Inviting in outside experts to presentation and critique provided opportunities for project reflections.

Once COVID-19 related restrictions eased and fieldwork resumed, the CoP meetings ceased as teams were suddenly very busy and catching up on lost time. Had there been a point person to lead collaborative activities on each team, the CoP momentum might have been sustained. There were also suggestions to have technical projects (upstream) involved in the cohort from the start to facilitate interaction and mutual learning between gender/social scientists and product development-focused scientists, which would have allowed them to adapt their projects to the learning along the way, instead of waiting to have the first full LVIF learning event in November of 2022 and at the end of the programme in November 2023. The projects also reflected that there would be an opportunity for much more cross-project synthesis, leveraging the significant body of comparable evidence that was generated across all four projects. Facilitating this in the context of EFPs, given project timelines and funding envelopes, is a challenge for IDRC to reflect upon.

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

The project was asked to include a risk assessment and propose mitigation measures. Almost all risk mitigation measures were applied and were effective. The unanticipated risk was the COVID-19 pandemic, and the team worked within their limits to work virtually where it was possible, and shifted to writing their implementation strategies in the first year of covid where field work was impossible. IDRC granted an initial 12-month extension which allowed them to complete the activities and milestones. Newcastle disease outbreak during and after the first round of vaccination affected progress, with some farmers attributing their loses to the vaccine provided by the project and other communities experiencing severe mortalities in their flocks. The project mitigated things with re-training of CVs, increased engagement with the communities on animal health and vaccination, and closer disease surveillance.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

No unforeseen ethical issues

## Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

This project was funded through the Livestock Vaccine Innovation Fund (LVIF), which was co-funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), Global Affairs Canada (GAC) and

Last Revised March 2021

IDRC·CRDI

IDRC. The fund was a 57$ CAD partnership of 8 years. It ended in March 2024. The Fund initially had a huge interest from GAC to have projects reaching women farmers while BMGF were less interested in the downstream type projects. BMGF did demonstrate a lot of interest as the projects moved along. A gender specialist working group was created by IDRC to discuss the best way to incorporate gender into the vaccine value chain for animals through a Call for Proposals. One of the main recommendations that came along was requiring gender leads as the PIs (not vaccine expert). Therefore, IDRC launched a closed call for proposals on addressing dimensions of gender inequalities and barriers in the livestock vaccine value chain. This project was one of 4 selected projects. IDRC really adopted a cohort approach with bringing the 4 projects together on a regular interval. The teams were also asked by IDRC to adopt the Women's Empowerment in Livestock Index (WELI) tool to create the possibility of meta-analysis for stronger data and greater impact of findings on women's empowerment.

The project had mitigated results but overall delivered very well; they especially delivered many training to the small-scale farmers. The pandemic delayed substantially this project, but 2 subsequent extensions allowed them to finish the work and be able to participate at the Women Deliver conference in Kigali.

The results demonstrated a role for community vaccinators (CVs) in the distribution and delivery of NewCastle Disease vaccines in remote areas, however CVs need close supervision by trained animal health assistants or veterinarians. The CVs had been anticipated to perform a peer education role, but this was not attained. In addition, the project observed that in climate changing areas, considering that smallholders sell their animals in drought moment, it is difficult to maintain a constant vaccine delivery.

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

As described in the PCR, the project team faced some challenges in implementing gender-transformative research, and the available training materials on gender integration were not very strong. IDRC provided support and guidance to the grantees to overcome these gaps and to apply gender-sensitive approaches in their work. The project also learned from the experiences of other similar projects that were part of a cohort funded by LVIF and benefited from regular check-ins and knowledge exchange with them. One of the main lessons from this project and the cohort is the use of community vaccinators in distributing and delivering vaccines in remote areas, with close supervision by trained animal health assistants or veterinarians. This approach was viable and effective in increasing vaccine uptake, improving livestock health, and empowering women and men in the communities.

The project contributed to IDRC's 2030 vision by empowering women through training and access to resources.
