# Project Abstract

The World Organization for Animal Health has identified farmed Pangasius (freshwater catfish) as an aquaculture species to benefit from vaccination, given high antibiotic use against bacterial infections from *Edwardsiella ictaluri* and *Aeromonas hydrophila*. A survey on antibiotic use in 2016 by the Vietnamese Department of Animal Health found 80% of Pangasius farmers lacked a therapeutic approach and applied a cocktail of antibiotics delivered throughout the production cycle. The only commercially available Pangasius vaccine was developed through 8 years of collaboration between University of Stirling, CanTho University in Vietnam and the fish vaccine company Pharmaq (Norway). This produced an injection vaccine (AlphaJect-1®) that was released in 2013, but farmers are reluctant to use this product.

In 2017, new policy legislations and veterinary laws restricting antimicrobial use in Vietnam were developed. Efficacious solutions are now required to ensure compliance. Understanding the barriers and catalysts affecting vaccine uptake is crucial to support the development and use of innovative vaccines and delivery mechanisms. Vaccination as part of a broader veterinary or farm "Vaccines against antimicrobial resistance in Aquaculture" health plan is needed to improve the health and welfare of the fish, reduce pathogen load in the systems, improve vaccination efficacy, and provide farmers with a cost-effective and viable alternative to antibiotics. Advances in vaccine development and delivery mechanisms require tools to detect immune responses correlated with protection, which are currently unavailable for Pangasius. This project tested two novel technologies, immersion vaccine and robotic immunization, both aiming to facilitate fish handling during the vaccination process. Vaccination by immersion was designed to induce protection against two important bacterial pathogens that affect the Vietnamese catfish industry. This type of vaccination reduces fish handling and stress. The robotic vaccination can be applied to any injectable vaccine and the objective of this technology was to reduce labour intensity, time during vaccination, and stress of fish. Both technologies were expected to have a positive impact on the adoption of vaccines by fish farmers. It was also expected that these technologies would reduce antibiotic use in the Vietnamese catfish sector. Additionally, this project also promoted the uptake of aquatic vaccines by building effective partnerships to provide farmers with efficacious and cost-effective solutions to reduce antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance.

# PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

The team developed three prototype vaccines: a monovalent Edwardsiella ictaluri only, a monovalent Aeromonas only and a combined or polyvalent vaccine that contains the circulating antigens representative of the 3 bacterial species, E. ictaluri, A. hydrophila and A. dhakensis which are the critical pathogens causing mortalities in the farming systems. The novel catfish immersion vaccine is considered by farmers as an attractive alternative to antibiotics.

The team developed robust laboratory methods for monitoring antimicrobial susceptibility testing to reduce AMR expansion. The production of a novel standardized protocol for antibiotic susceptibility testing delivered new knowledge applicable to the scientific community, especially those responsible for the treatment, diagnosis, and surveillance of AMR.

The team identified that 1 in 3 Pangasius farmers were reluctant to use vaccines (n=400) and the barriers to vaccination included a general mistrust of vaccination and more specific concerns about commercial profiteering from vaccines. The data on vaccine hesitancy within aquaculture is novel and directly contributes to the scientific and development/policy perspective related to AMR reduction. These data can be used to inform vaccine production as well as vaccination strategies/programmes and directly contribute towards achieving the National Action Plans on AMR reduction.

The team performed proof of concept studies using robotic vaccination. Machine vaccination in aquaculture remains a relatively novel approach. A feasibility study to test if robotic vaccination would be applicable for Pangasius was very successful. The pilot experiment confirmed the vaccination system parameters (needle position and penetration depth) where algorithms were adjusted to accommodate the biometric data and tested at varied weights/lengths of the fish. The results showed excellent vaccine administration with no gross side effects observed when fish at 10-30g +/- 2g were machine vaccinated.

The team developed several assays to help with the assessment of catfish immune response. For example, a total of 12 immune genes were identified from the Pangasius genome including those suspected to be involved in inflammation (IL-6, TNF-alpha), innate (C3 and lyzC) or adaptive immunity (MHCII). From these data, 5 absolute qRT-PCR assays were developed and validated for use in monitoring immunomodulation in the Pangasius post-vaccination. These tests are extremely important for the scientific community because there is a lack of assays in aquaculture research.

3. If appropriate, explain why outputs were not completed or were of poor quality.
Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

The research on this project was conducted with diligence and high-quality standards. All milestones were completed as planned. The COVID-19 pandemic affected the activities of the scientists with travel restrictions, access to the research facilities, and purchasing of reagents. As the project advanced some milestones were modified. For example, proteomic profiling of the bacteria was modified due to delays in receiving the isolates, consumables and inflated consumable costs. Prioritization was given to the bacterial characterization work which did not include proteomic profiles using MALDI-TOF MS as these data were not as critical to the development and testing of the vaccine and identification of the vaccine candidates.

Another example of adaptation to complete the milestones were observed post COVID-19 and Brexit insurance costs for the shipment of the vaccination machine for demonstration purposes. This activity was considered prohibitively expensive from the commercial company and instead videos of robotic vaccination were shared with the farmers during the training sessions.

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?
Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

Antimicrobial Resistance, at a global level, is a major threat to human and animal health. Antimicrobials play a critical role in treating mostly bacterial farm animal diseases. However, the high production farm systems and the non-prudent use of antimicrobials, in both human and veterinary medicine, are associated with the emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant micro-organisms (e.g. bacteria) and has been identified as a risk factor for human infectious diseases. Alternative products to antimicrobials, such as the proposed immersion vaccine technology, can play a crucial role in reducing the need, and hence non-prudent use, of antimicrobials in aquaculture (e.g. preventing infectious diseases altogether). Several bacterial pathogens affect finfish. The intensification of fish farming and the presence of multiple pathogens increase the challenge to control infectious diseases in aquaculture. These infections cause important economic losses to the catfish industry and raise concerns about animal welfare. There are few vaccines for finfish available in the market, but many farmers are reluctant to use them. Injectable vaccines in finfish, although efficacious, their application is labour-intensive and stressful for the animals. Additionally, there is a need to develop more vaccines to provide a broader protection against the diverse pathogens. Therefore, it is extremely important to develop new

vaccines that are safe and efficacious as well as easy to administer. This is the reason why polyvalent vaccines, particularly immersion vaccines, are a priority for finfish.

The team has generated a wealth of data and resources through this project that scientists will be utilizing for future funding applications, to reassess the potential of vaccine candidates in challenge trials. This team has created a network of scientists in Vietnam who work closely together to improve fish health and reduce antimicrobial use. This research contributed to several areas including molecular genetics, pathology, bioinformatics, immunology, vaccinology, and microbiology. The production of the novel polyvalent vaccine, fish immune markers and bacterial genomic data directly benefits the scientific community investigating alternatives to antibiotics and promotes improved fish health and welfare in aquatic food production.

# 5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

The outputs above were of high quality and are commensurate to the purpose and risk level of the first phase of the project. This project generated important information that contributed to scientific knowledge in the areas of bacteriology, vaccinology, immunology, and AMR, as well as molecular genetics. The knowledge acquired was presented in several conferences that reached students and scientists. The team also conducted surveys to understand farmers' needs regarding the use of vaccines and vaccination strategies, such as the use of machine vaccination. It also helped increase the understanding of the technology and its potential applications in other finfish species.

The objectives were ambitious but achievable. There were mainly two streams of research: the first one was the development of a polyvalent immersion vaccine, and the second one was the testing of an existing robotic arm tool for machine vaccination. For the first stream, the team developed the product based on the results from the behavioural studies questionnaire and hypothetical behavioural choice experiments. There were very few modifications to the milestones, which showed that the expected results were fairly accurate. These changes were mostly adaptations to continue with the research, while there were restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, follow up studies were not performed as the team had increased the participant number in the survey. However, the team assessed how the COVID-19 vaccination influenced the attitudes and beliefs of the target end-users towards fish vaccination. The proteomic profiling of the bacteria was modified due to delays in receiving the isolates, consumables and inflated consumable costs. All these issues were a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, the team prioritized bacterial characterization, which allowed identification and distinction of bacterial strains providing more information for the design of the vaccine.

# 6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.

Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

This project tackled an important gap: lack of innovative technological solutions to address some of IDRC's Development Outcomes. Thus, the project laid the foundation upon which subsequent work could be built to ultimately contribute to IDRC's Development Outcomes, especially "improving health for all". This technology addresses the health and economic negative impacts of two pathogens important for pangasius and other finfish species. Reducing Edwardsiella ictalurid and Aeromonas hydrophila infections and therefore, antimicrobial use, contributes to the development outcome "enhancing food and nutrition security" by reducing animal losses from disease and contributing to a sustainable animal health system for the future. The reduction in AM use also

contributes to increased food safety. Healthy animals are also more likely to adapt to climate change. Preventive technologies, such as vaccines, are an important tool to improve animal health, which has a positive impact in production and the reduction on the use of antimicrobials.

The team developed a vaccine and tested a technology for aquaculture application that aimed to reduced fish handling and stress. This new technology can increase animal health and reduce the need for antimicrobials. The development of the immersion vaccine was on discovery, and the team was able to achieve proof-of-concept studies. The design of the vaccine was a result of information obtained through surveys regarding farmer's needs and preferences. This paved the way to understand whether farmers would consider using the vaccine. There are very few biosafety measures established in aquaculture. Since the quality of water in many countries is less than optimal, infectious diseases are frequent and devastating. Vaccination decreases the impact of infectious diseases, including morbidity and mortality, which cause economic losses due to reduced production and increased food waste. Additionally, infectious diseases and antimicrobial treatments directly decrease food security. Vaccination improves fish health and with this, contributes to increase production. Additionally, healthy animals have better chance to adapt to climate change.

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

There were few problems identified during the granting process. The team had to wait for their research agreement until the government from Vietnam granted them country clearance. This delayed receiving funds from IDRC. However, once country clearance was obtained, all financial processes went smoothly and without any problems. The teams responded quickly and efficiently to all IDRC requests. All changes required to the budget of the project were requested by the team and approved by IDRC. The financial reports have been finalized.

The University of Stirling responded very quickly and had good communication. The recipient confirmed that their local contribution was GBP 81,080. MCE spent almost all the approved budget. The Recipient reduced their budget in local currency by 32,539,291 in order to manage forecasted currency deficits. The Recipient reported contributions of 1,432,230,655 VND and committed 1,098,160,000 VND in the Grant Agreement.

# STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

Several risks were identified before the start of the project that were related to the technology. The risks identified with the technology were mitigated by developing a proper research support package that included training on technology, regulatory, intellectual property, quality assurance, marketing / commercialization, and gender. In addition, the InnoVet-AMR team hired various consultants to evaluate the projects in several aspects, including feasibility of the technology to reach market, regulatory, intellectual property, and marketing / commercialization.

Two unforeseen challenges due to global pandemic and Brexit were encountered within the project and adjustments were made in the timing of the milestones. With the COVID-19 pandemic researchers experienced restricted or limited access to their research facilities, laboratories, or specialized equipment. Additionally, it hampered their ability to conduct experiments, collect data, or perform analyses during that period. Travel was also affected, which affected collection of samples, workshops, training sessions and in-person project meetings. Brexit accentuated the problems particularly related to the cost of goods. Any changes in the project activities as a result of delays incurred, were discussed within the project team and alternative solutions were found and approved by IDRC. This ensured minimal impact on the project achieving the deliverables. None of these challenges or remedial actions resulted in problems with ethical approval of the project activities.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the

project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

There were no risks that emerged throughout the project or problems/challenges related to ethics. Ethical approval for the project was granted from both the UK and the Vietnamese authorities, and each individual study required ethical approval before the research could start. In this project, the team applied for ethical approval using the UoS Animal Welfare and Ethical Research Board (AWERB) as well as the General University Ethical Panel or GUEP which deals with participant-based studies. The ethics approvals were received as requested and before the start of the experiments involving animals.

## Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

This project was one of eleven IDRC funded projects which were developed through the Innovative Veterinary Solutions for antimicrobial resistance (InnoVet-AMR), a partnership with the UK Department of Health and Social Care (UK-DHSC). The objective of this initiative was to develop alternatives (including vaccines) to antibiotics in the veterinary sector. The project focused on the aquaculture sector which is one of the fastest growing industries and one where antibiotics are used in high quantity. The focus of the InnoVet-AMR 2.0 was to develop new products and therefore a series of training opportunities was developed by IDRC to accompany the research teams in the product development process toward commercialization. This project has reached proof of concept on two different innovations: an immersion vaccine and a robotic vaccine delivery system for fish; this was one of the main indicators of success of the InnoVet-AMR program. Before finalizing the project and the program, a new phase has been negotiated with the UK-DHSC, InnoVet-AMR 2.0. A component of this new program will be to continue funding the projects of InnnoVet-AMR1.0 within a second phase. This project is well positioned to receive further funding in this new phase of funding.

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

The project demonstrated the feasibility and potential of developing and applying novel catfish immersion vaccines as an alternative to antibiotics in Pangasius farming systems. as described by the PO, the project also contributed to generating and disseminating new knowledge on the epidemiology, diagnosis, surveillance, and prevention of bacterial diseases and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in aquaculture. The project addressed the objectives of the Innovet-AMR initiative of IDRC and DHSC from the UK, which aims to reduce the use of antibiotics and the emergence and spread of AMR in livestock and aquaculture sectors in low- and middle-income countries.

The project also aligned with the IDRC climate resilient food system priorities, as it promoted the sustainability and resilience of Pangasius production, a significant source of income and food security for many farmers and consumers in the Mekong Delta region. A lesson for future similar projects is to consider the social and economic factors that influence the adoption of vaccines and other AMR reduction strategies, such as vaccine hesitancy, cost-effectiveness, and market incentives.
