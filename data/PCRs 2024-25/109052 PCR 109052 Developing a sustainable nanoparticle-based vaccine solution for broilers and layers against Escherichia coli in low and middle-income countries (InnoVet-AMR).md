# Project Abstract

One of the most common diseases in poultry farms is colibacillosis which affects both broilers and laying hens intensively reared for commercial purposes. Few strains, called "avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (E.coli)" are virulent and in poultry, these strains are responsible for systemic infections called avian colibacillosis. Part of this project will be carried out in Brazil, which is the world's second largest poultry producer, and particularly affected by E. coli infection. Given the potential economic losses linked to this pathology, high rates of antibiotics are used for both prophylaxis and treatment. However, the appearance of strains of E. coli that are multi-resistant to antibiotics make these treatments often ineffective. Vaccination as an alternative to antibiotics has the potential to provide an effective and specific protection, will induce an immune response, and thus will reduce the number of infections and consequently reduce the use of antibiotics.

The project proposes a new application of an existing vaccine technology based on a nanoparticle platform associated with bacteria to trigger a wide and effective immune response. When supplemented with adjuvants, it has been shown to enhance immunity in chickens, providing an additional layer of protection against opportunistic diseases. The proposed vaccine, made from bio-sourced products, is based on the potentiation of solutions that have already proven their efficiency, non-toxicity and stability in hot climate conditions, as well as being low-cost. The objective of the project is to validate the concept, determine the most suitable route of administration for both broiler and layer chickens, and to facilitate the commercialisation of the product by pharmaceutical companies. The research team anticipates the development of a nanoparticle-based vaccine formulation that will demonstrate superior efficiency in the post-challenge phase in comparison to existing commercial vaccines against E. coli.

# PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

- This innovative research project has developed an effective anti-colibacillosis vaccine (VXN-E.coli), based on inactivated APEC antigen and starch nanoparticles (NPL) for in ovo or mucosal application in broilers.
- The research team revealed that the vaccine quality control and the bioprocess production both were validated and reached the bench scale of 10,000 doses of each of three APEC bacteria serotype, i.e. around 30,000 vaccine doses per batch. Eight (8) in vivo proof of concept experiments were conducted with the partner Imunova, and demonstrated a greater safety, immunogenicity and protection of VXN-E.coli in comparison with available vaccine (Poulvac®E.coli, Zoetis).
- Results demonstrated that VXN-E.coli vaccination: (a). are safe through subcutaneous, intramuscular, mucosal and in ovo application (normal hatchability, no mortality, absence of toxic effects in chick embryos and during the adult life of broilers and layer hens); (b) in ovo and mucosal application induced higher immunogenicity (anti-APEC IgY serum titers and sIgA in cloaca) and protection against APEC challenge infection compared to the commercial vaccine, (c). had no impact in zootechnical performance parameters.
- Additionally, a large in ovo vaccination trial was performed with the bench scale vaccine batches, on 3000 eggs and the results corroborate safety and immunogenicity obtained in preliminary experiments. Furthermore, no interference with zootechnical performance parameters of broilers was detected and no impact on the viral combined mandatory vaccination, when applied together in ovo. It will be the first in ovo vaccine based on killed bacteria and NPL.
- Moreover, the technology developed can also be applied to combine different inactivated bacteria to create polyvalent anti-bacterial vaccines.

Progress update: | At the end of the project, the project has successfully achieved main objectives. It was possible to test the efficacy of the developed vaccine in the hatchability rate, observe the usability of the vaccine at the incubatory, compare the vaccinal response in broilers and in layer hens, analyze the usage of Safglucan as a vaccinal adjuvant. During the project, Vaxinano's work focused on large-scale manufacturing E.coli vaccine for in ovo vaccination field trial. Vaxinano developed the scale-up of the E.coli bioproduction process and produced for each individual E.coli strains the equivalent of 31,944 doses of vaccines. In parallel 4g of GMP nanoparticles concentrated at 20mg/ml were produced for the purposes of the study equivalent to 40,000 – 120,000 doses of vaccines according to the antigen formulation’s ratio.

The vaccine formulations were characterized and were sent to Imunova for in ovo vaccination field trial in Brazil. The team has demonstrated the vaccine proof of concept achievement in vivo trials that an in ovo. The vaccination trials have shown that the nanovaccine can protect chickens against a field strain of E.coli; the Zoetis vaccine based on an attenuated live bacteria didn’t protect the animals of the challenge model; furthermore, the vaccine was also demonstrated to be compatible in a commercial combined vaccine based on Marek, Newcastle and Infectious bursal disease. The study was performed on 3000 eggs.  |

Variance explanations (if any) | The project had planned to test a new adjuvant, which was supposed to have been developed by Lesaffre. However, the team encountered a tense communications issue, and Lesaffre team exits the project before its conclusion. This did not, however, affect the overall objectives of the project, since the nanovaccine produced satisfactory results with the nanoparticles formulation.  |

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?
Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

This was an early-stage project, carried out in a partnership between Vaxinano (France), Phileo by Lesaffre (France) and Imunova Análises Biológicas (Brazil) that aimed at discovery and proof of concept. The ultimate goal was to develop a safer, more efficient and innovative solution to prevent avian colibacillosis disease in poultry farming in Brazil. This research project made significant contributions to the global effort to develop innovative alternatives to antibiotics in animal production in LMICs. It contributed to the research field by providing an innovative nanoparticle vaccine in ovo nanoparticle-based vaccines based on inactivated Avian Pathogenic Escherichia coli bacteria (APEC) (VXN-E.coli). Furthermore, the experimental vaccine is composed of inactivated E.coli bacteria - three most prevalent Avian Pathogenic Escherichia Coli (APEC) serotypes in chicks - and lipidated starch nanoparticles (NPL) with or without Safglucan® adjuvant (Lesaffre). The main results obtained in the 4-years project consisted of:

(a) the vaccine formulation development including antigen and NPL bioproduction and quality control,
(b) safety and potency proof of concept, comprising a series of eight in vivo vaccination experiments. Different doses and ratios of antigen: NPL were tested in several vaccine schemes: subcutaneous, mucosal (eye/nose-drop), intramuscular, and in ovo single or multiple injections. In summary, VXN-E.coli mucosal and in ovo vaccination were safe with no interference in zootechnical performance parameters neither in eggs hatchability or in animal mortality. The nanovaccine induced improved humoral immune response in chicks – higher levels E.coli-specific IgY (serum) and secretory sIgA (cloaca) – correlated with higher protection rates against APEC challenge infection, in comparison with the Poulvac®E.coli commercial vaccine and unvaccinated control groups. Safglucan® addition to the vaccine schemes did not impact significantly any experimental parameter analysed.

Finally, VXN-E.coli was co-administered with the mandatory commercial anti-viral poultry vaccines (to prevent Newcastle, Marek and Gumboro diseases) in a larger in vivo safety and immunogenicity clinical trial. The in ovo application was used through an automated vaccination system in an industrial hatchery. Excellent safety and tolerance (hatchability, mortality) and no effects on animals' performance (weight, feed parameters) were observed during the 45 days after vaccination.

Overall, the candidate vaccine represents a safer and more efficient innovate solution to prevent avian colibacillosis losses in poultry farming, without the need for antimicrobial use within flocks.

The project had planned to test a new adjuvant, which was supposed to have been developed by Lesaffre. However, the team encountered a tense communications issue, and Lesaffre team exits the project before its conclusion. This did not, however, affect the overall objectives of the project, since the nanovaccine produced satisfactory results with the nanoparticles formulation.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?
Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.
Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy.
Provide specific numbers where possible.

Large-scale positive change:
This project is an early-stage discovery project aiming to develop a proof-of-concept on the potential use of in-ovo vaccine against Avian pathogenic E. coli infections. Although the project's impact on smallholder beneficiaries may not be immediate, it addresses an important related to the lack of innovative technological solutions to address some of IDRC's Development Outcomes especially "improving health for all". This project specifically seeks to develop novel formulated vaccine interventions that are easy to scale-up and convert into a commercial product. the vaccine represents probably the most affordable antibiotic alternative, which is extremely attractive for use in low- and middle-income countries. The research project, therefore, contributes to the "enhancing food and nutrition security" development outcome by reducing animal losses from disease and contributing to a sustainable poultry system for the future.

Supporting leaders of today and tomorrow:
This project improved the technical capacity of the Brazilian investigators in vaccine technology development, especially in the poultry sector. The project includes three private sector institutions one from LMIC (Brazil) and two PIs highly qualified in vaccine formulations and development from France. Additionally, 1 post-doc and 1 PhD student were trained in Immunova on in ovo vaccination, broilers health, and clinical trials. Additional lab and research technicians participated directly in the research, which helped them acquire the research skills needed in scientific research.

Partner of Choice:
This project was funded through a donor-partnership program comprising IDRC and the UK Government's Global AMR Innovation Fund (GAMRIF) – managed by the UK Department of Health and Social Care. In addition, the InnoVet-AMR Call for Proposals encouraged effective partnerships across the public and private sectors to coordinate better discovery, development, and sustainable delivery of the proposed veterinary solutions. The research teams had to include at least one researcher from an institution based in a low- and middle-income country as principal investigator or co-applicant. This project highlights the strengths of IDRC in supporting private sector engagement strategy. Since this project was engaging 3 private sector institutions: 1: Vaxinano Country/Region: France, Europe. 2: Imunova Análises Biológicas country/Region: Brazil, South America. 3: Phileo by Lesaffre Country/Region: France, Europe.

The project also faced challenges that may have been due to the involvement of only private institutions. This provided the ongoing chance for IDRC to collaborate with PS institutions while ensuring clear communication between PS partners. This project also offered the continuous opportunity for IDRC to partner with institutions in Brazil and the South America region.

## FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC’s administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

The project was selected for a second funding phase. It is worth noting that the project encountered challenges in its discussions with Lesaffre, who exited the project midway through due to unsuccessful technical results related to their technical contribution (the adjuvant proposed by Lesaffre did not meet the desired outcome). The overdue funds, amounting to 23,690 euros (equivalent to 34,863 Canadian dollars), were returned to the IDRC following a lengthy and persistent effort by GAD and the project officer in charge to secure their refund from Lesaffre. Notwithstanding the challenges, the project was ultimately successful in meeting its objectives, thereby representing a valuable investment for IDRC.

# STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

- One of the anticipated risks is related to the nature of the exploratory product development project, which presents the probability of not reaching the expected outcome and is identified for all the InnoVet-AMR projects. The research teams have provided and implemented a risk mitigation plan that has allowed the project to proceed. The team provided detailed technical reports on time and was very keen to provide all the documents we thought necessary. In addition, the IDRC program officers overseeing the project have maintained regular communication with the research team via laboratory visits.

- The COVID global pandemic represents a significant and previously unforeseen risk. The project encountered difficulties as a result of the interruption of activities during the pandemic, as well as the subsequent increase in the prices of laboratory products and consumables. This necessitated the acquisition of additional funds, personnel, and a revised project schedule. It is nevertheless noteworthy that the 18-month extension served to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.

- In October 2022, Phileo by Lesaffre was compelled to withdraw the project due to the inability to achieve successful results using their adjuvant Safglucan. The adjuvant proposed by Lesaffre was unsuccessful in achieving the desired outcome. At the project level, the objectives were met without delay. The technical challenges encountered during the performance of the experiments (vaccine formulation and in vivo trials) were successfully addressed thanks to the expertise of each of the project partners in their respective fields and the experimental protocols, resulting in exploitable results. The challenge encountered was the low solubility of the Safglucan adjuvant in aqueous media, which made it difficult to incorporate this compound into the vaccine formulation. Various techniques were employed to address this issue, yet none were able to fully homogenize the SG in the vaccine without compromising its colloidal stability. This may be a key factor contributing to the observed lack of adjuvant activity in the in vivo trials.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

The project has not raised any ethic related issue. The Immunova team responsible for conducting animal trials was forthcoming in providing the relevant ethical certifications and agreements.

# Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

This project was one of eleven IDRC funded projects which were developed through the Innovative Veterinary Solutions for antimicrobial resistance (InnoVet-AMR), a partnership with the UK Department of Health and Social Care (UK-DHSC). The objective of this initiative was to develop alternatives (including vaccines) to antibiotics in the veterinary sector. This project was

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC·CRDI

the only project focusing on developing vaccines as alternative to antibiotics in the poultry sector. Most importantly it was the only project of InnoVet-AMR with a partnership of 3 institutions from the private sector. The project is based in Brazil. This project faced various challenges. The first one being that Brazil had major complete shutdown of their institutions during COVID and therefore Immunova could not pursue some activities at certain times. The second challenge refers to the departure of Lesaffre from the project while being the lead institution of the project. Their departure was due to unsuccessful technical results related to their technical contribution (the adjuvant proposed by Lesaffre did not meet the desired outcome). And the third challenge is related to a constant difficult research team dynamic between Immunova and Vaxinano. Despite all these challenges the team was highly successful in reaching proof of concept of their proposed vaccine.

The focus of the InnoVet-AMR 2.0 was to develop new products and therefore a series of training opportunities was developed by IDRC to accompany the research teams in the product development process toward commercialization. This project did reach proof of concept; this was one of the main indicators of success of the InnoVet-AMR program. Before finalizing the project and the program, a new phase has been negotiated with the UK-DHSC, InnoVet-AMR 2.0. A component of this new program is to continue funding the projects of InnnoVet-AMR1.0 within a second phase. This project was selected to receive further funding in this new phase of funding and will therefore be able to pursue its development toward a successful commercial vaccine. Due to the mentioned challenges, the research team was modified to include a new Brazilian institution Embrapa and new researchers from Vaxinano have been added to the research team.
