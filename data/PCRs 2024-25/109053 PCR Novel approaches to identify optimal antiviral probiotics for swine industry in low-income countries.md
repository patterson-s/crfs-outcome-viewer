# Project Abstract

Effective control of major enteric viral pathogens (including rotaviruses) of livestock is critical for swine health and production. Unfortunately, poor biosecurity practices in many developing countries and the lack of efficacious vaccines and antivirals represent major challenges in controlling rotaviruses. Antibiotic-related practices, including preventative, indiscriminate, or improper antibiotic use, require urgent attention. Probiotics have historically been used to improve feed efficiency and the health of livestock animals. However, most findings on the health-promoting or antiviral effects of probiotics were inconclusive, inconsistent, or incomplete.

Rotaviruses recognize histo-blood group antigens on intestinal epithelial cells as attachment factors. This may affect their pathogenesis, and while certain lactobacilli bind different histo-blood group antigens that can block virus attachment to cells, some proteobacteria produce histo-blood group-like antigens that may directly bind different viruses.

The research team, a collaboration between Ohio State University and the University of Nairobi, seeks to understand if these underappreciated mechanisms of probiotic action can provide a stronger rationale for selection of optimal in-feed alternatives to compensate for the loss of antibiotic-related benefits and to combat enteric viruses and the associated secondary bacterial infections. These tripartite virus-bacterium-histo-blood group antigens interactions of selected immunomodulatory and antiviral probiotic/commensal bacteria in vitro and in vivo will be systematically evaluated. Porcine small intestinal enteroids will be used to identify histo-blood group antigens-expressing and antigens-binding bacteria, and to evaluate their ability to block rotavirus infection. Neonatal piglets will be used to evaluate the effects of probiotic-histo-blood group antigens interactions on protection against viral infections. It is expected that this will help

to reduce the use of antibiotics and improve sustainability of the swine industry in developing countries.

# PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

- This innovative research project has produced data supporting the ability of selected cocktail of commensal/probiotic bacteria to limit rotavirus (RVs) infections in pigs. Notably, several bacteria expressed Histo-Blood Group Antigen (HBGA), including E. coli Nissle 1917, E. coli G58 (A, B and H antigens), B. thetaiotaomicron and C. clostridioforme (A and H antigens), S. bovis, and B. adolescentis (H antigen).

- The research team revealed that Gram-positive E. coli Nissle 1917 and E. coli G58 present the ability to block Rotavirus attachment onto porcine intestinal epithelial cells, preventing the infection. Thus, these data supported our original hypothesis that physical interactions between RVs and HBGA-expressing beneficial bacteria may further limit RV replication.

- Experimental infection of gnotobiotic piglets (lacking their gut flora) conducted at the Ohio State University have demonstrated that probiotic/commensal bacteria cocktail based on HBGA expressing bacteria can mitigate the severity of rotavirus infection. Experimental infection of gnotobiotic piglets (lacking their gut flora) conducted at the Ohio State University has demonstrated that a probiotic/commensal bacteria cocktail based on HBGA-expressing bacteria can mitigate the severity of rotavirus infection.

- Experiments on conventional pigs at the University of Nairobi confirmed that inoculation of suckling and weaned piglets with HBGA expressing bacteria resulted in reduced number of piglets with diarrhea, shortened diarrhea duration and decreased diarrhea severity associated with Rotavirus A and C infections.

- Additionally, HBGA-expressing cocktails reduced Rotavirus A shedding prevalence to 50% compared to 67% and 75% in piglets supplemented with HBGA non-expressing bacteria and non-supplemented controls, respectively. These data suggest the probiotic formulation is efficient under authentic field conditions in piglets with established gut microbiome.

- This highly productive research project has increased the state of knowledge in the research field by publishing 7 peer-reviewed open-access research manuscripts with 3 more published in the process. Additionally, results from the research were disseminated via 9 presentations at various international conferences and 2 media coverage.

- The project also enabled the training of postdoctoral, PhD, and master level researchers, which built the expertise and experience needed to become the next generation of scientists in the research field.

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?
Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

This research project made significant contributions to the global effort to develop innovative alternatives to antibiotics in animal production in LMICs. It contributed to the research field by providing a deeper mechanistic understanding of probiotic interactions with rotaviruses (RVs) and host-related factors, particularly emphasizing the role of histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs). By elucidating how specific probiotic bacteria of the swine digestive system interact with RVs and host cells, the study addressed the inconsistency often observed in probiotic efficacy, especially in livestock animals. The research highlighted the genotype-specific recognition of HBGAs by RVs, underscoring the complexity of virus-host interactions and the need for tailored probiotic interventions based on specific RV genotypes. Furthermore, through comprehensive in vitro and in vivo evaluations, including experiments in gnotobiotic piglets and conventional pig models, the study demonstrated the efficacy of HBGA+ probiotic formulations in reducing virus shedding, delaying diarrhea onset, and mitigating diarrhea severity associated with RVA and RVC infections. These findings not only advance our understanding of probiotic mechanisms but also offer practical insights for improving swine health and welfare, ultimately contributing sustainable practices in the swine industry.

# Large-scale positive change:

This project is a discovery project aiming to develop a proof-of-concept on the potential use of probiotics against rotavirus infections. Although the project's impact on smallholder beneficiaries may not be immediate, it addresses an important related to the lack of innovative technological solutions to address some of IDRC's Development Outcomes especially "improving health for all". This project specifically seeks to develop prototype probiotic interventions that are easy to scale-up and convert into a commercial product. In feed probiotic supplementations also represent probably the most affordable antibiotic alternative, which is extremely attractive for use in low- and middle-income countries. The research project, therefore, contributes to the "enhancing food and nutrition security" development outcome by reducing animal losses from disease and contributing to a sustainable swine system for the future.

# Supporting leaders of today and tomorrow:

This project improved the technical capacity of the three key investigators in probiotic technology, especially in the swine sector. The project includes two junior investigators from LMIC and one established researcher/professor. Additionally, 1 post-doc, 1 PhD student and 2 master's level students were trained in probiotic technology, rotaviruses, swine health, and clinical trials. Additional lab and research technicians participated directly in the research, which helped them acquire the research skills needed in scientific research.

# Partner of Choice:

This project was funded through a donor-partnership program comprising IDRC and the UK Government's Global AMR Innovation Fund (GAMRIF) – managed by the UK Department of Health and Social Care. In addition, the InnoVet-AMR Call for Proposals encouraged effective partnerships across the public and private sectors to coordinate better discovery, development, and sustainable delivery of the proposed veterinary solutions. The research teams had to include at least one researcher from an institution based in a low- and middle-income country as principal investigator or co-applicant. This project highlights the strengths of IDRC in supporting southern partners in exploring and delivering sustainable solutions to smallholder farmers' challenges in Kenya. This project also offered the continuous opportunity for IDRC to partner with institutions in Kenya and the East Africa region.

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

The project experienced some delays in finalizing the grant agreement with the Ohio State University. The university itself, as a legal entity, faced challenges in accepting the IDRC Terms and Conditions. However, their Foundation arm was able to accept modified terms.

Initially funded at CA $1,501,400.00, the project received an additional CA $105,654.00 supplement, bringing the total funding to CA $1,607,054.00.

While the project was not chosen for a second funding phase, it's important to highlight that it successfully met its objectives, making it a valuable investment for IDRC.

# STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

- One of the anticipated risks is related to the nature of the exploratory product development project, which presents the probability of not reaching the expected outcome and is identified for all the InnoVet-AMR projects. The research teams have provided and implemented a risk mitigation plan that has allowed the project to proceed. The team provided detailed technical reports on time and was very keen to provide all the documents we thought necessary. In addition, the IDRC program officers overseeing the project have maintained regular communication with the research team via laboratory visits.

- The initial contract signing was delayed by almost 6 months, which caused delays with personnel hiring and some experimental work. Some other personnel were hired/paid, and some experimental work was conducted using Dr. Vlasova start-up, which allowed to partially compensate for the delay.

- The COVID-19 pandemic was one unforeseen risk. The closure of research facilities for more than a year resulted in significant delays and disturbances in research activities. The ILRI Farm, where the experimentation was planned to take place, shut down for several months on March 17th, 2020, due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Ongoing animal studies had to be terminated, and planned animal studies had to be postponed until farm staff could resume back to work in late July of that same year. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic also affected procuring chickens due to country-wide curfews, significantly delaying the planned animal studies. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that the 18-month extension lessened the impact of the pandemic.

- There was a delay in initiating the University of Nairobi experimental work due to the African Swine Fever Outbreak in Kenya and subsequent quarantine. To alleviate the impact of this delay, a part of the funding for personnel was used for research supplies/animal costs.

## 10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project?

You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

The project has not raised any ethic related issue.

## Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

This project was one of eleven IDRC funded projects which were developed through the Innovative Veterinary Solutions for antimicrobial resistance (InnoVet-AMR), a partnership with the UK Department of Health and Social Care (UK-DHSC). The objective of this initiative was to develop alternatives (including vaccines) to antibiotics in the veterinary sector. This project was the only project trying to develop a probiotic as an alternative to antibiotics in the swine sector as well as the only project focused on a viral disease as opposed to bacterial. The project was based in Kenya but highly led by Ohio State University. The focus of the InnoVet-AMR 2.0 was to develop new products and therefore a series of training opportunities was developed by IDRC to accompany the research teams in the product development process toward commercialization. This project contributed to the research field by providing a deeper mechanistic understanding of probiotic interactions with rotaviruses (RVs) and host-related factors. It was a discovery-based research project and did not reach proof of concept even though they have reached their objectives. Before finalizing the project and the program, a new phase has been negotiated with the UK-DHSC: InnoVet-AMR 2.0. A component of this new program will be to continue funding the projects of InnoVet-AMR1.0 within a second phase. This project will be able to apply for a phase 2 funding in this new phase of funding.

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project and to formally approve the report and its contents.

This project contributed to IDRC's strategic objectives in several ways. It aimed to develop a proof-of-concept for the potential use of probiotics against rotavirus infections. This could help reduce the use of antibiotics and improve the sustainability of the swine industry in developing countries, aligning with IDRC's objective of large-scale positive change. The project was part of the InnoVet-AMR initiative, a partnership between IDRC and the UK Government's Global AMR Innovation Fund, which aimed to develop alternatives to antibiotics in the veterinary sector.
