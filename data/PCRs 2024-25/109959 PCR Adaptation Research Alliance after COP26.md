## Project Abstract

Climate adaptation research must go beyond assessing risks and identifying impacts to focus on finding solutions that are user-centred and action-oriented. Current support for adaptation and resilience research is insufficient, lacking coordination, and not effectively linked to implementation to address the magnitude and urgency of the practical actions needed to build a climate-resilient future. During the United Nations' climate conference in 2021 (COP26), the Adaptation Research Alliance was launched to mobilize a coalition across a range of actors to scale up investments in adaptation and resilience research from both research- and action-funding agencies. This project will enable an established thought leader, Anand Patwardhan, to serve as co-chair of the Alliance during 2022 and 2023.

## PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

Alliance persists – Over the past two years, the Adaptation Research Alliance (ARA) almost doubled in size, growing to over 230 member organizations across 63 countries. Members include research-, funding-, policy-, and community- organisations that share a common goal to accelerate and scale investments in action-orientated research in developing countries. This continued existence is notable in contrast to efforts such as the Adaptation Action Coalition and Global Commission on Adaptation which largely ceased in recent years.

Strategic positioning – ARA convened two donor roundtables (London in April 2023 and Dubai in December 2023). ARA was also active at the United Nations' climate COP28 convening seven events. These activities provided fresh connections for IDRC including with novel actors such as Community Jameel and India Climate Collaborative. Yet the activities also underscore that the funding landscape for adaptation research is perhaps more modest than was anticipated in 2021. Over the past year, ARA engaged the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) submitting positions that drew together insights from members.

A pillar of CLARE – FCDO and IDRC collaborate on “Climate Adaptation and Resilience” (CLARE), with IDRC delivering the “research” pillar while ARA is key in the “partnerships” pillar. FCDO funding for the ARA secretariat is part of the CLARE budget (300126) via a direct accountable grant to SouthSouthNorth. By encouraging the Alliance, IDRC has strengthened its relationship with FCDO and CLARE. Bruce Currie-Alder is IDRC’s program leader for CLARE and sits on the ARA steering board.

Refreshed governance and learning – Over the past months, the Alliance has reflected on its functions and structures. This included a critical look at the Alliance’s value proposition and identification of priority activities for the year ahead. It became apparent that the Alliance secretariat was doing too much, and more responsibility deserves to be transferred to the membership. At the same time, the ‘tracking, learning and sharing’ activity was effectively transfer to Transitions Research in India.

## RESEARCH OUTPUTS

2. List up to 10 most important research outputs generated by the project. Where possible, provide the link.

Outputs are the directly achievable products of a project’s completed activities (e.g. policy briefs, journal articles, research papers, trained people, etc.). Indicate the project outputs that were published on an open access basis. What, if any, outputs resulting from this project will be published open access beyond the duration of the project, and it is possible that the grantee will seek further IDRC support for this?

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC·CRDI

- Written submissions to UNFCCC on global goal on adaptation and on the global stocktake the global goal on adaptation and on the global stocktake under the Paris Agreement.
- New round of 30 micro-grants for grassroots action research in 2023, plus lessons learnt from process
- Co-creation processes towards scoping opportunities for Alliance members to work together on nature-based solutions for equitable resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, and enabling Least Developing Country (LDC) universities to contribute to national adaptation.
- Consultancy on operational model reflecting on the way the Alliance is structured, makes decisions, works and interacts with its members and constituencies, and the extent to which this is congruent with and expressive of its core purpose (see Annex).

3. If appropriate, explain why outputs were not completed or were of poor quality.
Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

While the Alliance has continued to grow, it faces some challenges in maturing as an organization:

- Secretariat doing too much ranging from supporting the steering board, running a micro-granting facility (with awards valued up to GBP 15,000 each), coordinating membership and plenary meetings, conducting outreach to donors, tracking-learning-sharing among members, and engaging in advocacy within UNFCCC. In contrast, member organizations do too little and with little engagement after joining the Alliance. A useful reflection of the operational model was carried out (October 2023 - April 2024) rethinking ARA functions and structure.
- Missing funders – ARA events have felt unbalanced, with some key funding organizations are either absent (European Commission, USAID-Prepare, Bezos Earth Fund, Germany-IKI, Rockefeller) or represented by more junior individual (Gates, Wellcome, ACIAR) less able to speak on behalf of their organizations in making decisions or committing resources. Current membership and level of funding falls short of stated goal to “to accelerate and scale investments in action-orientated research”. At the same time, “plenary” of the entire membership have become unweildy, creating demand for smaller gathering of members that share common geographic or thematic interest.
- Leadership transition ongoing – The current grant was initially expected to see new individuals take over the role of Co-chairs of the steering board. This was delayed and is still forthcoming in 2024. This is now compounded by the search for a new head of secretariat and discussions on whether to shift the hosting organization away from SouthSouthNorth.

# PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Last Revised March 2021

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC·CRDI

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

The Alliance continues to play a valuable ‘bridging’ role gathering a diverse array of members into a network that connects from global policy processes (e.g. UNFCCC) to grassroots activity of local universities and community-based organizations.

# 5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

Looking back, some expectations around this granting period were transition from original-to-new leadership, the creation of new collaborative research programs, and some prospects for the financial sustainability of both the secretariat and Alliance activity. All of three of these points remain a work-in-progress.

An unanticipated results was rethinking the Alliance’s functions and structure, elucidating tensions within these and trade-offs given limited staffing (see Annex). Recent months saw the Alliance refine its value proposition and establish priority activities for the year ahead. This is a positive sign of maturing as a organization.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC’s strategic objectives?
Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

The Alliance advances the core objective of IDRC’s Strategy 2030 to mobilize alliances for impact. Through ARA, IDRC is part of a network with over 230 member organizations across 63 countries. It also offers a channel for knowledge sharing and positions IDRC as a key actor in this field. The Alliance reinforced IDRC position on the global stage, enhancing our visibility in the United Nations’ climate change conference and broader communities of adaptation action and research.

## 7. OBJECTIVES

Provide a comment only if the objective scored 1 or 2.

Meeting Project Objectives

On a scale of 1 to 4 (1 indicating that the project did not meet the objective and 4 indicating that it fully met the objective), please rate the achievement of each project objective.

General Objective: Enable the Adaptation Research Alliance to scale up investment in action-oriented, user-centred research that supports and informs adaptation planning and implementation.

☐4 Fully met
☐3
☑2
☐1 Not met

Comment: The aspiration to scale up financial investment in and for action-oriented adaptation research remains more aspirational than realised in practice. While the Alliance has convened ‘co-creation’ processes intended to inform new funding programs, these have by-and-large had modest influence to date.

Specific Objective 1: Support Professor Anand Patwardhan to provide leadership to the Alliance during 2022 and 2023

☑4 Fully met
☐3
☐2
☐1 Not met

Comment: Prof Patwardhan continued to serve as co-chair throughout the period.

## FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC’s administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

IDRC had previously negotiated a simplified agreement with the grantee with no reporting requirements. This continued to work well during this period.

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

Yes, the responsible officer both served on the Alliance steering board and largely represented IDRC at ARA events. This provided ample opportunity to monitor the co-chair's leadership and ARA activities under this grant, as well as interact with FCDO counterparts involved. The anticipated transition in leadership remains ongoing and will now be monitored as part of CLARE leadership, rather than through a grant.

The Alliance still needs to secure more funders as critical members, diversify its sources of support, and deliver on its promise to scale investment in action-oriented research and innovation. As anticipated, with growth in membership, the Alliance is refining its niche within the broader community of climate adaptation research and action.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

No. While support to Prof Patwardhan was bound by research ethics policy within the University of Maryland, no primary research was carried out under this grant.

## Program Leader comments

Not required as PL was responsible officer

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

As the director of CRFS, I would like to highlight some key lessons and ideas from the Adaptation Research Alliance project. As presented by Bruce in this PCR, the Alliance has grown to over 230 member organizations across 63 countries and is playing a valuable role in connecting global policy processes to grassroots activity. However, the Alliance faces challenges in its governance, funding, and leadership transition. The secretariat is overstretched, and more responsibility needs to be transferred to the membership. The Alliance also struggles to attract and retain critical funders and deliver on its promise of scaling up investment in adaptation research.

Despite these challenges, the Alliance has made progress in refining its niche, value proposition, and priority activities. As a member of the Alliance, IDRC has strengthened its relationship with FCDO and CLARE and has enhanced its visibility in the global climate policy arena. As we advance, the Alliance needs to secure more funders, diversify its sources of support, and continue to mature as an organization.

I want to congratulate Bruce for his leadership in engaging with the Alliance and highlighting the significance of IDRC's strategy in this initiative.

I approve this PCR

## IDENTITY

### Unique about ARA

- Seeks balance of North and South, emphasis on bottom-up.
- It brings together researchers, funders and practitioners/implementers.
- Knowledge needs to be produced with those who lead the action
- Number and diversity of member organisations.
- ARA can reach smaller actors that the big alliances and initiatives cannot

## RELATIONS

### Secretariat

- HR not enough, relative to ARA size (i.e. one person dealing with 50 micro-grants!)

### Steering Board

- Not engaged sufficiently, yet strong direction often on operational matters comes from co-Chairs.

### Members

- How to maintain connection with members.
- ARA is not investing sufficiently in building the network of members to enable them to come to the table, advocate for their findings or co-create new initiatives
- We need more structured and well-designed engagements
- Enable membership to lead the organization...

### Donors

- ARA doesn't have enough donors involved in its work.

## PROCESSES

### Concrete activities

- Main problem: ARA is doing too many things. ‘We cannot boil the ocean’.

### Research

- Research advocated by alliance: co-created, action-oriented.
- We don't identify interest, learn from and track member meetings, but we should

## RESOURCES

- irregular flow of resources.
