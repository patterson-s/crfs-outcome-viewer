# Project Abstract

A human rights and equity-driven approach to promote healthy diets can provide an effective and sustainable way to improve the health and rights of populations in developing countries especially vulnerable groups most often impacted by the risk of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Although there has been some recent research on how international human rights law frameworks could be leveraged to promote healthy diets and strengthen food systems, there is a need for in-depth localized analyses in collaboration with scientists, policymakers, and civil society in low- and middle-income countries with clear guidance on how specific and practical actions in research, policy, and advocacy can advance such efforts.

This initiative aims to support researchers, civil society organizations (CSOs), and policymakers engaged in the Global Regulatory &amp; Fiscal Capacity Building Program (Global RECAP) to strengthen their understanding and application of human rights-based approaches (HRBA) to regulatory and fiscal interventions to promote healthy diets, which may provide an effective and sustainable way forward for improving the health and rights of LMIC populations. These interventions can include legal, regulatory, and fiscal measures such as taxation on sugar sweetened beverages, nutrition labelling, food product reformulation, and restrictions on the marketing of unhealthy foods to children.

This project focuses on three (3) Global RECAP countries in East Africa, namely Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda with the following objectives: 1) to generate knowledge on how human rights frameworks, legal instruments and local and global actors can support a human rights-based approach to promoting healthy diets; 2) to identify knowledge gaps, capacity needs, and other barriers and opportunities for researchers, policy-makers and civil society organizations to make LMIC food systems more equitable, 3) to capture and share the experiences of researchers, civil society and policymakers to enhance learning, strengthen capacities in order to more explicitly interrogate and address questions of equity and vulnerability in their research efforts.

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

1. Through a scoping review that identified and evaluated academic literature and relevant international, regional and national legal and policy documents at the intersection of human rights and food systems, the project generated knowledge on how human rights frameworks, legal instruments and local and global actors can support a HRBA to promote healthy diets in LMICs. This output has been useful in synthesizing the ways in which a HRBA can be an added value in promoting healthier food environments and prevent diet-related diseases.

2. The main findings from the scoping review resulted in the development of a Conceptual and Analytical Framework (CAF) that produced a context-specific analysis on the application of a HRBA to advance regulatory and policy measures in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.

Based on the outcomes from strategic engagement with researchers, CSOs and policymakers in the Global Recap network working to promote healthy diets at the country level, three country reports were produced in collaboration with the Lead Research Partner to systematise the local evidence, which was summarized into three (3) country-specific evidence briefs. The briefs have been useful in refining the results of the initial research in line with country and regional contexts to advance the policy agenda promoting healthy diets at all levels.

The global and local knowledge produced through the above-mentioned findings were organized in a Synthesis Report, that identified knowledge gaps, capacity needs, barriers and opportunities for researchers, CSOs and policymakers in the three focus countries to be able to better contribute to a HRBA to the promotion of healthier food environments and the prevention of diet-related diseases.

3. Through the engagement of local stakeholders in policy discussions, focus group discussions and regional dialogue events, tremendous knowledge sharing and learning synthesis took place with numerous takeaways on entry points for using HRBA to advance the policy agenda to promote healthier diets and food systems amongst policymakers, Government representatives, regulators, CSO representatives, researchers, and academics. Research findings highlighting opportunities, challenges and barriers encountered in the three focus countries were also presented in global platforms such as the United Nation Inter-Agency Task Force for the Prevention and Control of NCDs and nutrition-related technical working groups and community of practice on Law and NCDs.

4. Formal and informal capacity development initiatives enhanced capacity of local researchers to conduct inter-disciplinary research at the intersection of law, human rights, food systems. This included one regional training and other regional discussions and dissemination events with a broad multisector audience from the three focus countries. The development and piloting of resources enhanced learning, strengthen capacities, and promoted collaboration by local actors working to promote healthy diets through human rights-based approaches. This further helped improve understanding of the role of HRBA in promoting healthier food systems through relevant policy and regulatory measures.

5. Strengthened South-South academic partnerships through the collaborative relationships built between the African national and regional institutions and researchers involved. North-South partnerships were also strengthened through the close collaboration established between the Global Resilience Partnership in Europe (Law and NCD Unit, University of Liverpool), the LRP from the (African Population and Health

A set of learning resources and tools (including Open Access publications) were produced to help researchers, civil society organizations, and policymakers improve their understanding and apply a human rights-based approach to promote healthy diets. IDLO - GLOBAL RECAP HRHD IDRC - Final Report

- A scoping report that describes the international and regional landscape of human rights frameworks, legal instruments and institutions. The review included international and regional human rights treaties and related instruments, as well as national constitutions, case law, and relevant legal and policy documents for each of the three (3) focus countries that can be used to support the integration of a HRBA to promote healthier food systems. (Annex C)
- Based on conceptual and analytical framework that contextualized the findings of the scoping review to the selected focus countries, three (3) country-specific evidence briefs were produced to support the dissemination of local findings. (Annex D, E, F).
- A synthesis report that identifies knowledge gaps, capacity needs, barriers and opportunities to the development and implementation of a HRBA to effectively promote healthier food environments and thus reduce diet related NCDs. (Annex G)
- Regional Dialogue Report outlining outcomes of the discussions and group work sessions from the regional dialogue. (Annex H)

- An online regional training on applying a HRBA to promote healthy diets and healthier food systems through relevant policy and regulatory measures was delivered to seven (7) local researchers involved in the three focus countries. The training was organized by the IDLO in collaboration with the Global Resilience Partnership (GRP) on the 17 February 2022.
- 45 key informant interviews undertaken in the three (3) countries (15 Kenya; 16 Tanzania; 14 Uganda; Female: 23; Male: 22)
- An online focus group discussion with ten civil society organizations representatives from the three focus countries with experience in conducting HRBA advocacy for policy change, including in health and food policy areas. The group discussion was organized by the IDLO and the GRP on the 17 June 2022.
- Multisectoral Regional Dialogue involving 24 stakeholders (F:15; M:9) from the three focus countries, including government representatives, regulators, CSOs, academics, and researchers was held in person to present and discuss the preliminary findings. This activity was organized by IDLO in collaboration with the GRP and LRP on 27-28 July 2022.

- Regional Dissemination Event organized by the LRP at which research findings were presented and discussed with a broad multisectoral audience from the three research countries led to an increased momentum in raising awareness around the role of HRBA in promoting healthier food environments and healthy diets. The event was held virtually on 5 December 2022.

3. If appropriate, explain why outputs were not completed or were of poor quality.
Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

The project produced high-quality research outputs that stakeholders can refer to in their understanding and application of a human rights-based approach to promote healthy diets. The minor challenges that were faced highlight the importance of continuing the production of locally relevant research in this area and capacity building of relevant actors.

For example, there were some difficulties in identifying and effectively engaging researchers and key informants at the country level with adequate technical expertise on the subject matter. Collaboration at the global level with the Law and NCD Unit, the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown and other members of the HRHD Advisory Board, resulted in exceptionally high-quality expertise on the legal and human rights research capacity of combining both human rights law and public health expertise. Whereas such multidisciplinary expertise in researchers was lacking at the local level.

Consequently, IDLO invested in additional resources and closer technical guidance in the development of local research expertise with a background in qualitative research, social science, and public health. This resulted in researchers being able to conduct quality interdisciplinary research and raise their interest in new research areas.

Gaps in country specific evidence and data on the application of human rights meant that researchers also struggled to contextualise the initial analysis conducted to specific country contexts. Nonetheless, this resulted in developing the capacity and raising the awareness of local stakeholders about the intersection between human rights and diet and food systems.

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?
Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

This research was important to fund because it generated knowledge through global and local research on the barriers, capacity gaps, lessons, and recommendations on the use of Human Rights-Based Approaches for policy and decision making for the promotion of healthy food environments in three countries of focus: Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. As the prevalence of diet related NCDs increases in Sub-Saharan, a human rights analysis of regulatory and fiscal interventions to promote healthy diets provides an effective and sustainable way forward for improving the health and rights of LMIC populations. A combination of health and HRBAs has been highlighted by global health researchers, civil society organizations and health and human rights advocates as a much-needed area for research and action. As research in this domain remains scattered, this project provided an in-depth localized analyses in concert with lawyers, scientists, policymakers, and civil society in LMICs with clear articulations on specific and practical actions in research, policy, and advocacy to promote effective regulatory and policy interventions to address diet related NCDs.

The knowledge generated has equipped stakeholders with additional capacity and tools to support the process of policy change through advocacy, policy making and regulation, research, and teaching. Some key findings included:

- The identification of relevant international treaties and conventions that can support the integration of a human rights-based approach to promote healthy food environments and thus prevent diet-related diseases. Using recognized human rights provisions in international, regional, and national legal systems was an entry point to reinforce the obligations of States to respect, protect and fulfil these rights as primary duty bearers under international human rights law and effectively regulate in this space.

For example, the literature review included human rights instruments emanating from the African Union and African Commission on Human and People's Rights, as well as documents underpinning regional trade arrangements, such as the East African Community and Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA). While the review of national materials consisted of national constitutions, policies and legislation related to HRBAs to the promotion of healthy diets and relevant case law. This analysis considered the utilization of human rights in addressing NCDs, as well as the ways in which these rights may be supportive or hinder efforts to promote healthy diets. This analysis was used to develop the Conceptual Analytical Framework.

Given that diet-related diseases are also a threat to sustainable development, with high economic, social, and environmental costs, this project being grounded in international human rights law and principles can accelerate the achievement of public health goals through human-rights based measures in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.

5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

The results of the project are in line with what was intended: New knowledge was generated on challenges and entry points for promoting healthy diets through HRBAs, alongside capacity strengthening resources informed by local knowledge gaps, barriers, and needs. Through a number of knowledge sharing opportunities, the experiences of researchers, civil society and policymakers engaged in Global Recap were captured to enhance learning, strengthen capacities, and facilitate collaboration by local actors in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.

The limited expertise at the local level on the subject matter required the design and implementation of significant capacity development and guidance to local researchers, which had not been factored into the original project workplan. The extended timeline allowed IDLO and research partners to finalize the systematic collection and analysis of local evidence and ensure that the final research products adequately reflected and captured local experience and lessons. The additional time (9months) also allowed for opportunities for the validation, dissemination and sharing of study findings at the regional level, including through the in-person Regional Dialogue, and to adjust the timeline of the research project in a way to feed into the Inception Phase of Global RECAP II. The extension did not entail any financial variation in the Project budget.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.

Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

## FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC’s administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

Nothing significant for the Centre. The extensions of 3 and 6 months was needed due to a need to align with other funding partners, and the time taken to establish contracts, capacity and ethic clearance with local partners. This may have been foreseen at the outset if the local research partners had had greater involvement in the design of the project, however this was an early project of RECAP and the development of working relations was in itself a useful outcome of the project.

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

Nothing significant.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

The attainment of local ethics clearance in each of the countries created some delays, especially in Uganda, however these were administrative delays and not due do unusual ethical concerns. The local research partner was able to navigate the process effectively when delays were becoming apparent.

## Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

I was PL when the project was approved and became the responsible officer after Zee Leung left the Centre. This project was unusual among the small cluster of RECAP projects as it was led and administered by one of the international partners, IDLO, working with local partners in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. An initial concern was the possibility of weak engagement and ownership of the results among local partners. However, this was both a capacity building effort and an exploration of the salience of human rights as a motivator or rationale for NCD prevention efforts, especially for regulations on unhealthy products. The results and outputs were well used in engagement and dissemination activities in the final months of the project, however their value is yet to be fully realised. Their use, and the employment of the new skills and talents of the country leads and trainees of the project will be valuable in the challenges soon to be faced at these three countries push forward with attempts to adopt regulations on ultra-processed products and policies that favour nutritious food.

The individuals and institutional partners from this project remain engaged in ongoing programming in East Africa.

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

As presented by Greg in this PCR, this project contributed to IDRC's strategic objectives by generating new knowledge on the barriers and opportunities for promoting healthy diets through human rights-based approaches and by strengthening the capacities and collaboration of researchers, civil society organizations, and policymakers in the Global RECAP network. The project also supported the creation of enabling environments for healthy diets, which is a core knowledge and impact area of the former Food, Environment, and Health program and the current Climate Resilience and Food Systems program. The project outputs have significant utility and will be applied to future work under the CCHeFS.

This is a great example project of how IDRC's strategy moved from FEH to a Food Systems transformation and how lessons from old programming are informing our current strategy.
