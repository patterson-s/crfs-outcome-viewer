# Project Abstract

Climate change is by far the greatest crisis the planet has faced in the modern age. Despite the Paris Agreement's commitments to climate action and the Sustainable Development Goals, the world is behind on reducing both carbon emissions and poverty. Parties are now revising national commitments to limit average global warming to well below 2°C, ahead of the first global stocktaking in 2023 under the Paris Agreement. However, a significant number of countries in the Global South are struggling to meet those commitments, especially given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and continuing development challenges.

This project seeks to increase the knowledge and capacities of six developing countries (four in Africa and two in Latin America and the Caribbean) to enhance climate action in a way that will be reflected at the 2023 global stocktaking. It will support tailored-to-context, participatory research, syntheses of knowledge and capacities for each of the six countries; train 84 young leaders from those countries on implementing and reporting progress of national climate action; and consolidate the capacities of 24 young specialist leaders, at least 60% of whom are women, to lead, advise, and communicate in the transition to a low carbon economy. Finally, it will secure the participation and engagement of researchers and practitioners from the Global South, particularly women leaders, in international climate forums, including the UNFCCC Conference of Parties (COPs) 26 to 28.

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

Over the past three years, Impulsouth has made significant strides in capacity building for climate action. Highlighted below are the most significant outcomes achieved:

- Strengthening the capabilities of emerging leaders in the Global South: 400 individuals were empowered with insights into global climate negotiations through brief training sessions, while another 62 participants received extensive engagement via certified specialized training, an incubation program, scholarships, and language training. These leaders are now better equipped to spearhead decisive climate action and engage effectively in global governance.

- Support provided to climate negotiation teams by funding the participation of 13 national delegates and offering training and support in policy development. Additionally, Impulsouth helped six research institutions participate in South-South cooperation, which expanded their networks.

- Developed a Solutions Lab which supports the implementation of key climate initiatives led by young leaders from the public, private and civil society sectors in Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Madagascar, Niger, Uganda and Zambia. The Solutions Lab played a catalyst role by establishing new institutions such as Niger’s Center for Education and Research in Climate Change and Health, and Uganda’s locally driven Farm &amp; Art Space, examples of innovative initiatives that are addressing climate change in ways that are localized.

- Generation and systematization of new knowledge through 10 scientific articles, book chapters, and gray literature reports.

- Fostering South-South cooperation for climate action, enriching the ecosystem with a guide on selecting countries to undertake south-south cooperation projects and embedding south-south peer-to-peer learning among those granted scholarships. Impulsouth was also a lead partner in the South-South Capacities Day of the 5th Capacity Building Hub at COP28.

- Impulsouth gained recognition among UNFCCC Secretariat partners such as the Committee on Capacity-building (PCCB), which enabled them to reach governmental authorities from developing countries to scale up results.

These accomplishments underscore efforts to address capacity gaps in the Global South, crucial for expediting the climate transition. While not every endeavor in the implementation phase achieved success, the project team perceives these challenges as invaluable learning opportunities.

The course faced challenges due to shifting from pandemic-era schedules to hybrid work, leading to difficulties in finding time for online training. Synchronous sessions across multiple time zones and language barriers, especially in Africa, and complex content in

Module 2 contributed to lower engagement and higher drop-off rates. Feedback indicated that flexible scheduling, reduced content demands, and better support for language and internet issues are crucial for improving course effectiveness.

This first phase of Impulsouth has provided profound insights into the essential components necessary for fostering effective, nationally owned, and sustainable capacity-building initiatives. These insights will guide the second phase of Impulsouth, aiming for even greater impact.

## RESEARCH OUTPUTS

2. List up to 10 most important research outputs generated by the project. Where possible, provide the link.

Outputs are the directly achievable products of a project's completed activities (e.g. policy briefs, journal articles, research papers, trained people, etc.). Indicate the project outputs that were published on an open access basis. What, if any, outputs resulting from this project will be published open access beyond the duration of the project, and it is possible that the grantee will seek further IDRC support for this?

1. Completion of the Knowledge Management Cycle (CKMC): The CKMC was designed, tested, and implemented to address climate actions conducted by young leaders from developing countries. Comprising four steps - researching to identify demands and capturing knowledge, organizing and storing knowledge, training for sharing and transferring knowledge, and applying solutions to climate action challenges - the CKMC has been successfully established.

2. Consolidation of a consortium for capacity building composed of organizations from the Global South. This consortium developed a combined virtual and in-person methodology that has proven effective in fostering climate action appreciation. The innovative methodology has undergone continuous improvement to ensure efficacy. The Impulsouth website, disseminates information across the LAC and African regions.

3. A systematic and comprehensive approach towards conducting research and informing policy decisions at the national level. This involved:

i. Establishing agreements with national governments, indicating collaboration and support from governmental bodies.

ii. Developing guidelines for conducting national research focusing on a specific theme to assess existing knowledge and capabilities.

iii. Conducting six national assessments based on these guidelines, with findings shared through an online platform, likely to reach a wider audience.

iv. Utilizing the research findings to update and inform policymaking, resulting in the creation of five policy documents.

4. Fostered multi-stakeholder collaboration and knowledge exchange to advance climate action through tailored dialogues, action plans, scholarships, and scientific articles:

7. 24 seed grants provided for leaders to implement climate action activities, oriented toward strengthened implementation of National Plans and inputs to the 2023 global stock take.

8. Fostering engagement and promoting a South-based climate action narrative through networking and global public events:
i. A network was established, including a LinkedIn group with 73 members, two WhatsApp groups for Solutions Lab participants, and one WhatsApp group for COP attendees, all with high participation rates.
ii. A South-based narrative of climate action was promoted through 26 public events organized in global arenas, both virtual and face-to-face.

9. Supporting diverse and active participation in major climate conferences and forums at both global and regional levels
i. Eighteen active participants, with at least 60% women, were supported to engage at COP 26, COP 27, and COP 28.
ii. Twelve active participants were supported at global and regional forums such as COYs, Regional Climate Weeks, PCCB events, and GCF board meetings, with an additional eleven participants supported at other global and regional events.

3. If appropriate, explain why outputs were not completed or were of poor quality.
Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

Although the project achieved most of the expected results, the initial scope and anticipated outcomes were ambitious, aiming for widespread influence. However, constrained funding and nascent partnerships meant that not all anticipated outcomes were fully realized. Nonetheless, an unanticipated yet significant systemic achievement emerged: the establishment of a benchmark for South-South cooperation in capacity building for climate action as reflected by its position to co-host to the Capacity Building Hub on the South-South Cooperation Day, fostering south-south peer-to-peer learning, as well as the development of guidelines on the selection of countries to work on south-south cooperation projects. The emergence of this collaborative community and approach holds limitless potential for driving deep transformations towards equitable, Southern-driven responses to the climate crisis.

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?
Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

South-South Learning: Traditional approaches often confine professionals to familiar methods and perspectives rooted in their respective regions. However, by fostering collaboration among professionals from diverse geographies, Impulsouth has unlocked a wealth of fresh thinking and learning opportunities. This cross-pollination of ideas has enriched the project's approach exponentially

Country-Driven Prioritization: Impulsouth designed its strategy in alignment with national priorities and commitments. Through consultations with UNFCCC focal points, research topics and partnerships were chosen. This ensured that the project's efforts are not only relevant but also directly contribute to advancing national communications and priorities.

Action and Learning Oriented Approach: Impulsouth embodied a philosophy of learning by doing—a continuous cycle of action and reflection. Most project activities and outputs were reflected upon, with lessons learned integrated into subsequent stages. This iterative process ensured that the project remains responsive and adaptive, constantly evolving to meet emerging challenges and opportunities. Impulsouth succeeded to build a management approach that is not the usual project management approach, as it required flexibility and trust from partners, mostly the funder; constant context analysis; and proximity to partners. While the pandemic and the rise of virtual meetings initially eased geographical and language barriers, the return to normalcy brought forth challenges, with partners facing heightened agenda demands and limited availability for virtual engagements.

5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

Paula Ellinger, as project manager, implemented the participatory leadership model, which, along with clearly defined divisions of duties among organizations such as UNU and FLACSO, and the active involvement of their delegates in the Steering Committee, effectively facilitated Impulsouth in fulfilling its commitments.

AVINA provided a robust institutional framework that instilled confidence and offered support in undertaking ambitious goals in regions and areas characterized by weak institutional and political contexts. Overcoming the challenge of deploying operational and managerial tasks in African countries where AVINA had not previously operated was made possible by AVINA's institutional responsibility. Additionally, AVINA's establishment of a regional office in Africa further facilitated the fulfillment of these commitments.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy. Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

This project has contributed to the following two IDRC's strategic objectives: 1. Share knowledge for greater uptake and use, increasing the reach and impact of IDRC-supported research in driving solutions, and influencing national, regional, and global development agendas, including by synthesizing and communicating results. 2.

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

As discussed earlier, the lofty ambition of this global project, spanning six countries across two continents, occasionally surpassed its initial financial capabilities. Nevertheless, despite unexpected occurrences such as the political turmoil in Niger, AVINA's diligent financial management enabled it to achieve the anticipated results.

# STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

Many of the risks were associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which presented unique challenges for project execution, particularly concerning international travel and participation in COPs and Regional Climate weeks. Adopted measures and the cancellation of in-person meetings helped mitigate these risks.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

While the project did not encounter any significant ethical research challenges, the military coup d'etat in Niger necessitated managerial and administrative adjustments in line with measures adopted by the Government of Canada, which have impacted the expectations of researchers in Niger. Nevertheless, the project has successfully managed to overcome these frustrations.

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

This project aimed to identify the key knowledge and capacities needed by developing countries to enhance climate action and report progress at the 2023 Global Stocktake. By COP 28, it had empowered 53 young professionals, supported 20 youth-led solutions (70% by women), and gained recognition for capacity building through South-South cooperation. It also contributed to southern engagement with the UNFCCC, including submissions and strengthening climate negotiators' participation in global governance.

The creation of Impulsouth, an alliance of organizations promoting South-South cooperation, is a significant legacy. This alliance set a benchmark for capacity building in climate action, fostering peer-to-peer learning, and developing guidelines for selecting countries for such cooperation projects. This collaborative community approach has great potential for driving equitable, Southern-driven climate responses.

The project successfully increased each country's capacity to engage with the Paris Agreement and the UNFCCC Global Stocktake, focusing on young people and women as change agents. A young researcher from Niger highlighted the benefits of being part of the Solutions Lab, including networking, presentations, publications, and co-sponsoring research theses.

Phase II will build on Phase I's model and methodologies, leveraging a diverse, gender-inclusive network of Southern climate stakeholders to strengthen the capacities needed to drive a just and equitable energy transition. Further, Impulsouth is aligned with other important locally led climate initiatives such as BASE (Building Approaches to Fund Local Solutions with Climate Evidence) as well as SIE's Care-Climate Nexus work that can expand the reach and learnings from this project.

Erin Tansey, Director, Sustainable Inclusive Economies Division Nov 2024

## Action Items / Next Steps

Building on the network of partners and the lessons learned next steps will involve creating a sustainable platform that will implement a training-of-trainers program that provides small grants to innovative capacity-building initiatives, builds repositories of information for capacity builders across the Global South, and organizes global dialogues to channel the lessons learned with policymakers and national climate stakeholders. By creating a network of trainers to implement capacity-building initiatives that promote energy transition in the Global South, ImpulSouth Phase 2 aims to support the consolidation of a new paradigm in the climate and energy sectors and demonstrate the value of building a gender-just energy transition.
