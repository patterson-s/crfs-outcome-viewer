## Project Abstract

Within the context of the nutrition transition in Africa, Tanzania is facing complex challenges, including stunting, wasting, micronutrient insufficiencies, overweight and obesity. These challenges are related to the physical, economic, political and socio-cultural contexts in which people decide about acquiring, preparing and consuming food, and include a low level of consumer advocacy for nutritious dietary interventions.

This project undertook a nationally representative quantitative audience survey in sampled regions across Tanzania's administrative zones as well as qualitative research to better understand food choice behaviours of consumer groups, targeting sampled regions that have specific nutritional concerns. The project results will be disseminated broadly to relevant stakeholders and provide decision-makers with credible evidence regarding which communication outputs are most effective at influencing specific social and behavioural changes. They will also support consumer voices for effective and accountable public policies to improve the Tanzanian food environment.

This project is funded through the Catalyzing Change for Healthy and Sustainable Food Systems (CCHeFS) initiative, a co-funding partnership between IDRC and the Rockefeller Foundation.

## PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

This project was funded by the CCHeFS initiative to fill data gaps on better understanding of diverse food environments across different regions, and the role of communications to enhance consumer voices to support healthier food environments in Tanzania. The project was led by the BBC Media Action research team in Tanzania, initially funded for a 6-month period, and had an

ambitious data collection agenda within this short time period. The most important outputs and outcomes of the project are:

1) **Nationally representative survey** – A nationally representative audience survey was conducted to establish a quantitative baseline of male and female Tanzanians' attitudes, understanding, knowledge, and ability to engage with and influence their communities' food environment and nutrition-related issues. This is one of the first surveys on this topic to be conducted in Tanzania, and covered all administrative zones of the country. The team also ensured that different climatic zones of the country were represented, and target regions with specific nutritional concerns such as high rates of obesity, overweight, stunting and climate-related food shortages. The final data set and insights from the data are novel and particularly useful for the Tanzanian context.

2) **In-depth qualitative data to better understand Tanzania's diverse food environments** – A mixed-methods study was conducted which included ethnography, community mapping, in-depth interviews and focus discussions. This qualitative research was conducted to understand the food environment and its variation across communities, including existing opportunities, barriers, and relevant policies to inform the consumer voices and communications work. The data collection underwent thorough analysis, including gender, socio-cultural and economic variables. Some key highlights of the results showed that while there is a general understanding of nutrition, access and consumption of healthy foods is shaped by varying physical, economic and sociocultural factors, such as affordability, geographic location, seasonality, transportation barriers, and socio-cultural food beliefs and preferences. This rich dataset with accompanying insights is valuable in ensuring a more nuanced understanding of diverse food environments across the country, as well as the consumer habits and constraints, and can contribute to more tailored approaches whether in policy or communications activities. The data has already been shared with key stakeholders and will be made publicly available.

3) **Audience segmentation** – working closely with the communications arm of BBC Media Action and a dedicated gender specialist, the research team conducted an audience segmentation analysis (based on the identification of segmentation variables and subsequent cluster analysis) to identify 5 audience segments. Detailed profiles of the audience segments were developed, including details on socio-cultural and economic factors, food consumption beliefs and habits, as well as media and information consumption habits, and advocacy behaviours and constraints. These segments

Figure 2: Audience Segments Related to Food Security and Voicing Up

4) Communication framework – a key milestone to close the project was a final dissemination workshop, where key stakeholders in the Tanzanian food systems space were invited to a debrief on the research results, but importantly also to co-develop a communications framework that can be utilized by the BBC Media Action production arm, as well as other key stakeholders working towards healthier food environments in Tanzania. A key output of this workshop was a communications framework, co-developed by the stakeholders in attendance (comprised of researchers, journalists, food and nutrition experts, public health specialists, gender experts and communications experts). This communication framework is expected to be used across content of the BBC Media Action team in Tanzania, which includes online and radio programming, that can help to increase awareness and amplify consumer voices on healthier food environments. Collectively, the qualitative and quantitative evidence generated from the project highlighted existing gaps in knowledge and identified effective social and behaviour change approaches to amplify consumer voices and promote a healthier food environment.

5) Capacity development – A key outcome of the project is enhanced capacity of both individuals and BBC Media Action as an organization. The project enhanced the research team's capacity, particularly in using mixed methods, rapid ethnography, and triangulating findings to provide comprehensive insights into the key themes of the project. The project allowed key members of the research team to fulfill new roles, and the training on rapid ethnography was identified as a key positive outcome for individuals involved including researchers and freelancers who supported the qualitative study. At an institutional level, the project supported BBC Media Action's understanding of the health and food systems space, including on the research and ethical permitting process in Tanzania. The opportunity provided by the project to do a nationally representative survey and to conduct more in-depth gender analysis was also highlighted by the team. Finally, the connections made with others operating in the food systems, health and nutrition space through this project has helped to widen the network of BBC Media Action

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

The idea for this project emerged as a result of a gap in CCHeFS programming on the ‘consumer voices’ pillar of work, as well as a desire to fund more work in Tanzania. It was important to fund this research, envisioned as making important contributions to both the CCHeFS portfolio and the national context of Tanzania. Firstly, the research methodology and the anticipated proposed communication approaches are instructive to the CCHeFS community on bridging the data gap on consumer food environments and opportunities for enhancing consumer voices. Secondly, the data collected is of tremendous use to others working on understanding and transforming the Tanzanian food system, through the nationally representative and region-specific research results and insights, as well as the tailored ideas for communications approaches provided by the segmentation and communications outputs.

The key results of the project show how important political, socio-cultural, and economic contexts affect individuals of different age groups, geographical locations, genders, and regions regarding their engagement with the food environment. The data collected showed the diversity in individuals and communities across Tanzania, and the analysis generated valuable insights into the barriers, opportunities and potential multimedia approaches that can help to support meaningful dialogue as we work towards healthier food environments.

For example, the data showed that using larger subcategories such as gender can help to generate context-specific approaches to improving consumer voices and consumption patterns.

Women, for example, make significant food purchases, preparation, and serving decisions in the majority of areas studied. However, due to patriarchal norms and entrenched socio-cultural beliefs, most women are not able to influence habit or consumption changes. Hence, efforts are needed to sensitize both women and men in their diverse contexts to ensure healthier and more affordable foods for their families.

Through the audience segmentation and communications framework activities, the project was able to identify much more targeted communication approaches to reach key parts of the populace, all of whom have different roles to play in influencing food consumption and the wider food environment. Through understanding of the barriers and opportunities, and use of targeted messaging and approaches, these findings can be used to support individuals and communities to create space for dialogue and change towards a healthier food system in Tanzania.

While the project duration was short and the research activities themselves limited, the project has generated valuable data sets and insights that have been made available to others in the food system space. The project team has committed to additional dissemination activities after IDRC funding has ended, including targeted outputs for different Tanzanian stakeholders to be able to access the results (e.g. policy briefs and final research report), and integration of the data into ongoing BBC Media Action programming that has the potential to reach large audiences in Tanzania (both in radio and online programming). The project has also resulted in new relationships, and an additional project to be funded by the CCHeFS program.

5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

There were no unintended outcomes of this project.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.

Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

1. Intermediate outcome 1: Informing policy: The detailed insights provided by the research of this project (including insights on community and individual consumption habits and interactions with the food environment, based on a nationally representative survey, the first of it's kind) have shown signs of feeding into the national policy framework for Tanzania, as evidenced by interest from and collaboration with the Tanzania Food and Nutrition Centre (the national government's technical arm on food and nutrition).

2. Intermediate outcome 2: Informing practice by public and private sector actors: The outcomes of the research project are contributing to improved understanding of consumers in Tanzania and application of these insights can be used by a variety of public and private actors engaged in improving the food environment. For example, the audience segmentation insights will feed into existing programming supported by BBC Media Action, and ensure that the general public is targeted through programming (on radio and/or social media). The data has also been shared publicly with other actors working in this space, who are likely to use it in their own practice (including researchers, civil society and media organizations who are already programming on health and nutrition).

3. Intermediate 5: Southern voice and leadership: The insights from the research are unique to Tanzania and led by a Tanzanian team, and have taken into consideration a

strong gender lens throughout the research process. The decision of the research team to integrate the final project dissemination workshop into an international festival organized by BBC Media Action (INSIGHTFUL) in September 2024 have also paved the way for a broader international audience. The research team plans to continue this dissemination even after project closure, through multimedia programming, technical briefs and academic publications.

Comment: The project team successfully completed an audience segmentation after in-depth data analysis, which identified different communication approaches for diverse segments of the Tanzanian population, which was validated and enhanced through a stakeholder consultation workshop. This includes platforms relevant to different ages, gender and socio-economic groups, thus this objective was successfully achieved.

## FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC’s administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

The project faced delays at the start, as ethical and research permit clearance had to be obtained by the team first before the grant could be issued. This is a condition of IDRC and resulted in a budgetary challenge for the BBC Media Action team, as they are 100% donor funded and were not able to cover the permitting cost (since they could not claim this as an expense, as the grant date would only begin after the permits were obtained). This presented a difficult situation, and in the end we reimbursed the cost of the permit through a small contract funded through the CCH/eFS Learning RSP. This permit conditionality prior to the grant is something that ideally should be re-considered, or at least we should have some central funds dedicated to cover such costs in the future.

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

The project was considered low risk, given the short duration, strong team capacity, and focused nature of the research. The recipient being a new grantee of IDRC was the main identified risk, however no issues arose as clear support and guidance was provided to the team and regular monitoring ensured that activities stayed on track. Financial and technical reports were all delivered in a timely and high-quality manner. The project was granted a short no-cost extension to finalize project wrap up activities due to delays in obtaining the research permit at the start of the project.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

No ethical issues were identified for the project, with the only barrier the condition of IDRC for the team to obtain ethical approvals prior to the grant being issued. The study involved research on human subjects, and complied with ethical research practices such as voluntary participation, informed consent, confidentiality and anonymity. Both the research permit and ethical clearance were obtained from the relevant authorities in Tanzania (National Institute for Medical Research and Commission for Science and Technology). The research team also obtained authorizations from the local government level which helped to ensure community acceptance and smooth data collection.

IDRC·CRDI

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

This is a well written PCR and record of the outcomes and lessons from the project. I am especially pleased to read of its success and the lessons from engagement between BBCMA and the government and civil society organisations who all had valuable learning from the project. It is unusual to have such an organisation (BBCMA) leading the process for this kind of national study, but impressive to see its delivery in such a short time and being put to use with local stakeholders. As stated above, the national survey and accompanying qualitative studies are unique and addressing an important gap in Tanzania.

The project was an important forerunner for a subsequent project involving partnership between BBCMA, Ifakara Health Institute and other local institutions in Tanzania and Kenya to advance on the recommendations and insights into increasing consumer understanding of food environments, and their voice toward public policy actions in the two counties. I imagine the planned collaboration among these organisations, and the intentions to motivate policy would not have happened without our encouragement and guidance to BBCMA from the outset of this project. Nor would any of it have happened without the prior partner relationships and field knowledge that Sarah had in Tanzania. Kudos to Sarah and team.

I approve of the PCR and final closure of this project.
