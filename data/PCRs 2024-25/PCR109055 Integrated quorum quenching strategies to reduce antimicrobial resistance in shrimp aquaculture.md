## Project Abstract

Shrimp farming is one of the most important species in aquaculture, contributing to more than 50% of overall aquaculture production in 2016 (FAO, 2018). Shrimp is also one of the target species in the Malaysian Agriculture in line with the Malaysia Economic Transformation Program with the aim of increasing shrimp production and productivity. Outbreaks of acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease, caused by *Vibrio parahaemolyticus*, affect the industry with serious economic losses. Recently, *Vibrio* sp. has shown multi-resistance towards antimicrobials. However, shrimp lack adaptive immunity, which makes vaccination ineffective. Therefore, it is important to find new alternatives to prevent or treat shrimp infectious diseases.

This project sought to test a novel technology that is based on disrupting the communication, called quorum sensing, that exists between microorganisms, including pathogens. The technology offers a promising alternative strategy to shrimp farmers to control bacterial pathogens. This project determined the best application methods of quorum quenchers to reduce *Vibrio* infections and antimicrobial resistance in a simple and cost-effective approach. Selected microalgae and its associated bacteria were used as probiotics for two purposes: a) To produce quorum quenching molecules that specifically block quorum sensing signals associated with activation of *Vibrio*; b) To produce a green-water system that promotes shrimp health and growth. The technology uptake by farmers (particularly women farmers) was also investigated. The new technology has the potential to modernize shrimp aquaculture industries around the world and reduce the need for antimicrobials.

## PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

A total of 210 shrimp specimens were collected from seven farms located in different geographical regions of Peninsular Malaysia. Overall, 13 different *Vibrio* spp. were isolated and characterized using the pyrH gene, including *V. parahaemolyticus* (55%), *V. communis* (9%), *V.*

campbellii (8%), V. owensii (7%), V. rotiferianus (5%), Vibrio spp. (4%), V. alginolyticus (3%), V. brasiliensis (2%), V. natriegens (2%), V. xuii (1%), V. harveyi (1%), V. hepatarius (0.4%), and P. damselae (3%). A large percentage of these isolates were found resistant to antimicrobials. For example, 100% of the isolates were resistant to penicillin G, although only 4% were resistant to norfloxacin. Additional studies found that the bacteria isolated from water were resistant to at least 8 antimicrobials, including tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, sulphamethoxazole / trimetrophin, penicillin G, neomycin, azithromycin as well as ampicillin and cephalexin or chloramphenicol. These results showed the prevalence of Vibrio sp. resistant to antimicrobials and the importance of reducing the use of AM to decrease AMR.

Three potential quorum sensing technologies for reducing vibrio infections in shrimp were developed. The shrimp fed with the quorum quenching probiotics demonstrated high growth rate and less vibrio counts compared to the control shrimp. The probiotic technology, which was meticulously selected based on its properties, showed its superior effects over the other two technologies. These results showed the benefits of the technology for shrimp farms.

Quorum quenchers were successfully isolated from shrimp water samples. A benthic diatom known as Halamphora sp. and its associated bacteria demonstrated good quenching properties and were further chosen as the probiotic candidates tested in the form of algae-biofloc and probiotic feed. This was an important achievement that allowed the scientists to do the characterization, including challenge studies, of the quorum quencher probiotics.

The team showed that the quorum quenching technology can increase the survivability and body weight of shrimp, which could lead to increased revenue for shrimp farmers (based on the trials). This also reflected that the use of quorum quenching technology could help reduce the use of antibiotics in shrimp aquaculture.

The farmers intention and experience in product adoption were investigated. Based on the team's analysis, 63.4% (n=78) of the shrimp farmers have high knowledge about the shrimp product technologies while 36.6% (n=45) of the farmers have low knowledge. Interestingly, 74% (n=91) of the shrimp farmers have an intention to adopt any new and improved technologies while 26% (n=32) of the shrimp farmers do not have an intention to adopt the technologies. This important finding can help in the future marketing and commercialization of the technology.

3. If appropriate, explain why outputs were not completed or were of poor quality. Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

The research on this project was conducted with diligence and high-quality standards. All milestones were completed as planned. The COVID-19 pandemic affected the activities of the scientists with travel restrictions, access to the research facilities, and purchasing of reagents. As the project advanced some milestones were modified to correct the curse of their research and achieve the objectives and improve the outcomes. For example, the team sought to use chicken anti-quorum sensing IgY antibodies as quorum quenchers. They tried immunizing chicken embryos but got inconsistent immune response results. They also tried mice to induce anti-quorum sensing molecules IgG with good results, but low amounts were purified. They finally were able to induce IgY in two hens, which allowed them to continue with testing of their hypothesis. This troubleshooting is common in biological research since the expected results are hard to predict. Nonetheless, the team was able to achieve this milestone.

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area? Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

Antimicrobial Resistance, at a global level, is a major threat to human and animal health. Antimicrobials play a critical role in treating mostly bacterial farm animal diseases. However, the high production farm systems and the non-prudent use of antimicrobials, in both human and veterinary medicine, are associated with the emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant micro-organisms (e.g. bacteria) and has been identified as a risk factor for human infectious diseases. Alternative products to antimicrobials, such as the proposed quorum quenching technology, can play a crucial role in reducing the need, and hence non-prudent use, of antimicrobials in animal agriculture (e.g. preventing infectious diseases altogether). Several bacterial and viral pathogens affect shellfish, such as shrimp. The intensification of shrimp farming and the presence of multiple pathogens increase the challenge to control infectious diseases in aquaculture. These infections cause important economic losses to the shrimp industry and raise concerns about animal welfare. Vaccines for shellfish, such as shrimp, do not work because they

lack the branch of immune system targeted by vaccines. Therefore, it is extremely important to find alternatives that could be used to prevent or treat infectious diseases in shrimp.

The team has generated a wealth of data and resources through this project that scientists will be utilizing for future funding applications, to reassess the potential of vaccine candidates in challenge trials. This team has created a network of scientists in Malaysia who work closely together to improve shrimp health. This research contributed to several areas including molecular genetics, pathology, bioinformatics, immunology, nutrition, and microbiology. The team worked on developing a technology that could be used to prevent and treat shrimp infectious diseases. Since preventive measures, such as vaccines, do not work on shrimp, farmers heavily rely on the use of antimicrobials. This is of public concern due to possible leakage to the environment. Quorum quenching is a novel technology that promises to contribute to the control of Vibrio species, some of which also affect humans.

5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

The outputs above were of high quality and are commensurate to the purpose and risk level of the first phase of the project. This project generated important information that contributed to scientific knowledge in the areas of bacteriology and AMR, as well as molecular genetics. The knowledge acquired was presented in several conferences that reached students and scientists. The team also organized workshops to present the technology to farmers and government officials. Contribution of this research helped advance knowledge on AMR in shrimp. It also helped increase the understanding of the technology and its potential applications in veterinary medicine.

The objectives were ambitious but achievable. There were very few modifications to the milestones, which showed that the expected results were fairly accurate. Other than troubleshooting assays or experiments, there were no major changes. The project run smoothly, although it was greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.

Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

This project tackled an important gap: lack of innovative technological solutions to address some of IDRC's Development Outcomes. Thus, the project laid the foundation upon which subsequent work could be built to ultimately contribute to IDRC's Development Outcomes, especially "improving health for all". This technology addresses the health and economic negative impacts of Vibrio infections, some of which are zoonotic. Reducing Vibrio infections and therefore, antimicrobial use, contributes to the development outcome "enhancing food and nutrition security" by reducing animal losses from disease and contributing to a sustainable animal health system for the future. The reduction in AM use also contributes to the increase food safety. Healthy animals are also more likely to adapt to climate change. Preventive technologies, such as probiotics, are an important tool to improve animal health, including shellfish. which has a positive impact in production and the reduction on the use of antimicrobials.

The team developed a novel technology for aquaculture application. However, this technology has the potential to be used in other species. This new technology has the potential to increase animal health and reduce the need for antimicrobials. The application of the technology was on discovery, and the team was able performed proof-of-concept studies. This paved the way to understand whether the quorum quenching technology could be used in aquaculture. There are very few biosafety measures established in aquaculture. Since the quality of water in many

countries is less than optimal, the current probiotic technology offered to reduce this gap. Particularly because the selected probiotics can be beneficial for the water environment. Having healthy animals improves the adaptation of aquaculture species to climate change. It also decreases the impact of infectious diseases, including morbidity and mortality, which cause economic losses due to reduced production and increased food waste. Additionally, infectious diseases and antimicrobial treatments directly decrease food security.

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

This team had to wait for first payment until the country clearance was approved. In the extension of the project triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the amendment to the Research Agreement included the IP agreement. This IP agreement was linked to payments. It took this team close to 12 moths to get the IP agreement signed by their university authorities. This delayed some payments. Other than these two issues, the financial process went smoothly. The team always responded very quickly to IDRC's inquiries. The problems mentioned above were out of the team's control because the documents had to go to their legal and then, be approved by their board who does not meet frequently. Most of the delay was caused by the Board of Directors.

Overall, the Recipient spent approximately 98.4% of the approved budget. The Recipient has reported savings of 74,488 MYR (23,431 CAD) and there was a 3% (CAD 2,693) in exchange rate losses.

# STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

Several risks were identified before the start of the project that were related to the technology. The risks identified with the technology were mitigated by developing a proper research support package that included training on technology, regulatory, intellectual property, quality assurance, marketing / commercialization, and gender. In addition, the InnoVet-AMR team hired various consultants to evaluate the projects in several aspects, including feasibility of the technology to reach market, regulatory, intellectual property, and marketing / commercialization. During the field trial, the team encountered a challenge related to temperature management, which is crucial for maintaining optimal conditions in the shrimp culture system. The impact of climate change further exacerbated the difficulties they faced during their hatchery trials. However, the team was able to address this problem and conducted the clinical studies with success.

One of the identified risks for this project was the country clearance approval. The InnoVet-AMR team established processes that allowed the team to apply for country clearance in a timely manner.

One risk that was considered and yet, became an issue was the IP agreement that was included with the amendment of the Research Agreement for the extension of the project. Signing the IP agreement took about 12 months due to the Recipient's internal processes that required review by their legal department and then by the Board of Directors. The latter delayed the signing process.

One risk not identified was the COVID-19 pandemic, which was one of the major challenges faced by the researchers due to the Movement Control Order (MCO). Researchers experienced

restricted or limited access to their research facilities, laboratories, or specialized equipment. Additionally, it hampered their ability to conduct experiments, collect data, or perform analyses during that period. Field trials were interrupted as the researchers were not allowed to travel during the MCO leading to delays and modifications in the research plans. Mitigation strategies, such as extension and supplement of the project, were developed to overcome these challenges.

## 10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project?

You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

There were no risks that emerged throughout the project or problems/challenges related to ethics. Although shrimp is considered a minor species, the team conducted their research with high ethical standards. The ethics approvals were received as requested and before the start of the experiments involving animals.

## Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

This project was one of eleven IDRC funded projects which were developed through the Innovative Veterinary Solutions for antimicrobial resistance (InnoVet-AMR), a partnership with the UK Department of Health and Social Care (UK-DHSC). The objective of this initiative was to develop alternatives (including vaccines) to antibiotics in the veterinary sector. The project focused on the aquaculture sector which is one of the fastest growing industries and one where antibiotics are used in high quantity. The project specifically tackled the shrimp industry which needs innovative alternative to antibiotics ideas since shrimp do not have immune systems, which makes the use of vaccines impossible. The focus of the InnoVet-AMR 2.0 was to develop new products and therefore a series of training opportunities was developed by IDRC to accompany the research teams in the product development process toward commercialization. This project has reached proof of concept; this was one of the main indicators of success of the InnoVet-AMR program. Before finalizing the project and the program, a new phase has been negotiated with the UK-DHSC, InnoVet-AMR 2.0. A component of this new program will be to continue funding the projects of InnnoVet-AMR1.0 within a second phase. This project is well positioned to receive further funding in this new phase of funding.

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

As presented by the PO, the project developed three potential quorum-sensing technologies for reducing Vibrio infections in shrimp. The shrimp fed with the quorum quenching probiotics demonstrated a high growth rate and fewer Vibrio counts than the control shrimp. This is a significant achievement that has the potential to modernize shrimp aquaculture industries around the world and reduce the need for antimicrobials.

One lesson for the future is the importance of being prepared for unforeseen risks. The COVID-19 pandemic was a significant challenge that affected the project, but the team's resilience and ability to develop mitigation strategies to overcome these challenges is a testament to our strength. This highlights the importance of adaptability and resilience in unexpected events. challenges
