# Project Abstract

Kenya must evolve its food system to reduce the burden of malnutrition and thereby improve public health and national economic growth. There is a need not only to reduce the incidence of undernutrition, but also to address the obesity and chronic illnesses associated with overnutrition. The challenge is to make sustainable healthy foods the preferred option among consumers rather than ultra-processed, less healthy foods. This can be achieved in part by making sustainable healthy foods consistently available and affordable to all consumers, including the poorest.

This project seeks to identify the conditions that can influence microbusinesses in informal and rural contexts to contribute more to equitable food system transformation, in particular for extremely poor women, and to strengthen microbusiness owners' household food consumption. It will examine incentives for businesses to change as well as the factors that influence demand, and how they are shaped by gender. The project will convey new knowledge on policy measures and interventions that can encourage business production, market interaction, and demand for healthy and sustainable foods. To meet its goal, the project will use a comprehensive mixed-method approach comprising systematic reviews, household surveys, qualitative interviews, value-chain analysis, natural experiments, and econometric modeling.

This project will be funded through the Catalyzing Change for Health and Sustainable Food Systems (CCHeFS) Initiative, a co-funding partnership between IDRC and the Rockefeller Foundation.

# PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

**Generated new knowledge and enhanced visibility:**
This project resulted in 5 policy briefs and 1 blog that highlight the challenges and opportunities for enabling food retail Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) to supply healthy and sustainable food to their local communities. Furthermore, as a result of stakeholder engagement activities, the project's findings were disseminated to a variety of audiences including policymakers and the private sector. The project also attracted the attention of local and regional media resulting in 16 media mentions till date.

**Catalyzed policy dialogue:**
The project team engaged policymakers and key stakeholders at the sub-national (county) and national level. Policy briefs were developed by the project team and disseminated via a national workshop and three county-level workshops. The national dissemination workshop that held in Nairobi attracted the presence of a senior government official - The Principal Secretary for the Kenya State Department of MSEs - Hon. Susan Auma Mang'eni. After the workshop, Hon. Mang'eni invited the project team for further conversations on supporting food MSEs. The county-level engagements also led to some key developments. For example, the Bungoma County Government together with the Bungoma Chapter of the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI) stated that even after the project ends, they will continue convening key actors to facilitate MSE advocacy, market linkages, access to training and advisory services, and knowledge sharing. In West Pokot County, the County Executive Committee Member (CECM) for Trade &amp; Industry and the CECM for Culture, Gender and the Youth committed to partner with KNCCI (West Pokot Chapter) to convene a working group to intensify ongoing consultations over rationalization and harmonization of taxes and empowerment of women and youth-led businesses.

**Advanced South-South collaboration:**
Building on this project, IDRC provided an "impact grant" to a research consortium that includes Wasafiri, the African Population and Health Research Center, the University of Rwanda, the Partnership for Child Development, and the School of Public Health, Imperial College London. The new grant is entitled "Leveraging school feeding and micro and small enterprises to promote access to healthy and sustainable food among the urban poor in Kenya and Rwanda". This goal of this new grant is to promote access to and consumption of healthy and sustainable food in schools in Kenya and Rwanda by promoting its demand and enhancing the role of MSEs and small holder farmers in its provision through engagement, capacity building and advocacy. Wasafiri will be leading the component of the project that aims to find better ways to integrate MSEs in food procurement and distribution systems. Wasafiri will work MSEs to self-organize into community-based agri-business associations, and build their skills for public engagement with local communities and schools.

**Gender implications:**
In line with literature, the project found that food retail MSEs were predominantly women-owned, with men focused mainly on wholesale and supplies, and transportation. However, contrary to the literature, the project found that owners of food retail MSEs reported that they started these businesses to exploit entrepreneurial opportunities and not merely for subsistence. Another unexpected finding was that women-owned food retail MSEs significantly outperformed their male-counterparts in terms of business earnings, even though they required less start-up capital to set up their businesses. These findings could potentially inform policies and programs aimed at empowering women-led food retail MSEs to profitably supply healthy and sustainable food to their local communities.

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

The key findings from the project are as follows:

- Households in the study areas are not consuming enough healthy and sustainable foods. The study areas included two rural communities and one urban informal settlement in Kenya. Households in these areas cited various reasons for their limited intake of healthy and sustainable foods including seasonal scarcities, affordability issues (due to high costs relative to incomes), insufficient awareness regarding nutritional value and recommended consumption levels, as well as taste preferences, cultural traditions, and perceptions, among other factors. The project team went a step further to investigate the prices of healthy and sustainable food categories compared to unhealthy food. They found that there was in fact no significant price differences. These results suggest that perceptions of the affordability of healthy and sustainable foods may be misinformed.

- Food retail MSEs, majority of which are women-owned, are the most influential actors in the local food systems. About two-thirds of food consumed by households in the study areas come from food retail MSEs. Local markets and the farm gate are the main sources of food supplies, suggesting that local production and food sourcing by food retail MSEs and their suppliers are key cogs in the local food systems. Food retail MSEs play a critical dual role of sourcing food from highly dispersed sources and connecting/completing the local market loops, including "bulk breaking" of food products into smaller affordable units.

- The healthiness or sustainability of food products are not key considerations in the business decisions of food retail MSEs. Generally, the food retail MSEs were mostly interested in factors that affect the bottom line – high demand, high profit, cheaper supplies, and getting food products to consumers in convenient packages and at affordable prices. These findings also reflect the local food environment, where consumers give highest priority to the cost of food and low priority to health, nutritional or environmental sustainability considerations.

- Unfavorable business conditions are stifling the potential of MSEs to venture into making healthy and sustainable foods more accessible to consumers. Business owners cited several barriers hindering them from prioritizing healthy and sustainable foods including high prices, seasonality, unavailability, and high transportation cost. More generally, they noted that the food retail market was characterized by too many competitors, high operational costs, and high number of customers who purchase on credit. They also noted that food retail MSEs lack collective action groups to facilitate market linkages, training, advocacy, and knowledge sharing.

- The business environment for food retail MSEs is governed by incoherent and unfavourable policies. On one hand, Kenya has a roster of comprehensive policies and regulations that, in theory at least, could promote healthy and sustainable food systems. However, an analysis of these policies and strategies point to gaps not only related to their ambitions and implementation, but also a lack of explicit policy measures focused on facilitating the success of food retail MSEs. Additionally, many of these policies and strategies lack strong legal and operational frameworks, are constrained by limited resources, and are characterized by insufficient coordination between national and sub-national authorities.

Several key recommendations emerged from these findings including:

- National and sub-national policymakers need to develop and implement policies and strategies to support food retail MSEs to source and sell healthy and sustainable food products. Such policy interventions could include instituting measures to review supply chain and business taxation regimes to make them more progressive and predictable, combating informal taxation, reducing multiple taxation, and providing tax incentives for food retail MSEs. Importantly, there needs to be greater coherence and coordination across multiple government departments whose policies have direct or indirect impact on the food retail business environment for MSEs.

- Where applicable, sub-national governments should put more effort into domesticating relevant national level policies. For example, Kenya's National Food and Nutrition Policy could be adapted into County Food Systems Strategies that can guide the transition towards healthy and sustainable local food systems. These sub-national strategies should pay greater attention to the economics of food supply and access and utilization, specifically, consumer purchasing power, by addressing the income gaps among low-income households to enhance affordability of healthy and sustainable foods. For example, county school feeding programs should focus on ensuring that school-going children have equitable access to healthy and sustainable food. At the same time, county governments should facilitate the participation of local MSEs in their school feeding programs.

- Food retail MSEs reported being deterred from selling healthy and sustainable foods due to challenges such as high risk of pests and disease attacks, expensive farm inputs, climate variation, and high cost of production, especially labor. Public-private partnerships could help provide the resources, innovations, and skills that MSEs need to overcome these challenges. For example, private actors could collaborate with a government agency such as the Micro and Small Enterprises Authority to design and implement initiatives aimed at establishing competitive supply clusters, market infrastructure, and cold chains for highly perishable heathy and sustainable food commodities. Such initiatives could include integrate financial inclusion products to incentivize food retail MSEs to expand their inventories of healthy and sustainable food items. Lastly, private-public partnerships could

help MSEs to establish functional local business associations. These business associations could then facilitate market linkages, training, advocacy, and information sharing among MSEs leading to a more efficient business environment.

5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

There were no unintended outcomes from this project. The project timelines were delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic so a three month no cost extension was approved.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.

Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

- Invest in high-quality research and innovation in developing countries:

This project generated new knowledge on the challenges and opportunities for MSEs to contribute significantly to making sustainable healthy foods accessible in Kenya. Traditionally, agri-food policies have focused either on the first mile (production) or last mile (consumption). However, this project highlights the "hidden middle" of key intermediaries (MSEs) that are probably the most influential actors on whether and how consumers access healthy food affordably and sustainably. The project provides actionable recommendations about how the policy and business environment can be reformed to enable MSEs to successfully engage in providing health and sustainable foods to the communities that they serve.

- Share knowledge for greater uptake and use:

The project developed five policy briefs. One policy brief targeted national-level stakeholders and the others targeted sub-national (county) level stakeholders. These policy briefs were distributed through workshops held at both national and county levels, drawing diverse stakeholders, and generating commitments to future actions. These commitments are all directed towards fostering a business environment conducive to enabling MSEs in food retail to provide healthy and sustainable food options for their local communities.

## Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

This was one of the first projects within the CCHeFS portfolio to start and to generate results and was uniquely focused on small food businesses. This remains a gap in the intended outcomes of CCHeFS. At the outset, I admit I hoped for a clearer set of findings and recommendations, especially for policies that could improve prospects for SMEs to play a greater role in efficient but profitable supply of healthy foods (local or not). However, the project highlights the complexity of the operating environment at the local level for SMEs, especially as they lack collective influence at a municipal or national level.

The findings or conclusions in relation to consumer demand and the relative costs of healthy food are perhaps lacking depth and validity. This was not a strong focus of the project and lacked researchers with experience in methods to assess this effectively.

In our ongoing support to Wasafiri through the above-mentioned project (partnership with APHRC) we might encourage efforts to publish in the academic literature. While the local dissemination and engagement of stakeholders was a legitimate priority for this project, it does seem to miss an opportunity to share the learning more widely.

Ideally, we should consolidate learning from across programs and projects where there has been a focus on food SMEs to better understand how the findings of this project compare and contrast. This would be useful to more clearly articulating the added value of the project and role it has had in realising the intended outcomes of CCHeFS, especially since few other projects have studied SMEs at a community level.

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

As presented by the PO, the project uncovered insights and policy recommendations related to the challenges and opportunities faced by micro and small enterprises (MSEs) in the food industry, as well as the factors influencing consumer preferences for healthy and sustainable foods. It's worth noting that the project involved engagement with various stakeholders at both national and sub-national levels and fostered collaboration with other research partners in the global South.

The project also focused on the gender dynamics within food retail MSEs, revealing that women-owned businesses tended to outperform their male counterparts in terms of earnings and efficiency. The PL's comments highlighted critical lessons learned from the project, including the crucial role of food retail MSEs in local food systems, the need for supportive policies and programs to enable these enterprises to provide healthy and

sustainable foods, and the multifaceted nature of consumer preferences influenced by factors such as affordability, availability, awareness, taste, culture, and perceptions.

This PCR reminds us that any potential future interventions should prioritize addressing these factors to enhance consumer education and increase access to diverse and nutritious foods. Gender considerations in the food retail sector, the challenges and opportunities faced by women-owned MSEs, and the importance of accommodating these nuances in policy and program design were also emphasized, making the audience feel included and considered. Lastly, the report advocated for continued support of South-South collaboration to amplify the impact and scalability of research projects, facilitating knowledge exchange and cross-learning among partners addressing similar issues in different contexts.
