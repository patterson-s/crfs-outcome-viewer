# Project Abstract

Natural environments in the West Indian Ocean region are facing alarming rates of degradation due to anthropogenic impacts on the environment. Recurring cyclones and extreme fluctuations between droughts and intense precipitation are having significant impact on communities.

Despite the urgency of the situation, dialogue between decision-makers and civil society about sustainable coastal and ocean management has been largely ineffectual. To better address these pressing issues, the DIDEM project encouraged effective dialogue by enhancing opportunities for scientific findings to inform actions of decision-makers.

DIDEM built on the results of the Sustainable Blue Economy conference held in Nairobi in 2018, and it contributed to operationalize the Nairobi Work Program on adaptation to climate change. Focusing on three sites (Islands and Archipelagos, Deltas and International Waters, Deep Sea and Seamounts) in seven countries (Comoros, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles, and Tanzania), the project had three main components: 1) delivering innovative tools and methodologies to West Indian Ocean decision-makers at all levels from local to regional; 2) training experts who can advise local decision-makers; and 3) awareness raising, education and partnership with civil society.

DIDEM set out to empower decision-makers and communities by giving them the scientific knowledge needed to inform policy dialogues and socioeconomic developments such as sustainable infrastructure design, disaster-risk management strategies and fishery resources management. Capacity strengthening of early career researchers and local decision-makers has also been a central component of the project.

The IDRC grant covered the project components focused of resilience building in river deltas in four of the DIDEM countries and ensured integration of that component in the larger DIDEM project funded by other donors.

# PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

The larger DIDEM collaboration was selected following a peer-review process and was approved for funding by the Fond Français pour l'Environnement Mondial (FFEM). DIDEM is a partnership between several donors and research partners, and in its initial phase – which corresponds to the time IDRC contributed financially – was coordinated by the Institut de recherche pour le développement (IRD) in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the Societe' Explorations de Monaco (SEM), the INTERREG funds in Reunion Island, the Fondation de France, and the Groupement de recherche international - Sud (GRDI).

In the framework of this project, IDRC supported the Western Indian Ocean Deltas Exchange and Research Network (WloDER) – which was set un via previous grant 108535 – in their participation and leadership of the DIDEM activities in the river deltas sites.

Regional stakeholders included the Western Indian Ocean Marine Sciences Association (WIOMSA) and the following IRD groups: the Espace pour le Développement (EspaceDEV); Ecologie Marine Tropicale des Océans Pacifique et Indien (ENTROPIE); Geomatics Research &amp; Development (GRED); Marine Biodiversity Exploitation and Conservation (MARBEC) and Patrimoines Locaux, Environnement et Globalisation (PALOC).

DIDEM had the following main outcomes:

- It created a long-term network of researchers and decision makers in the West Indian Ocean, whose sustainability in time is now partially ensured by the strong interest of FFEM to move to a second phase of funding (on the down side, this has

- It formed a critical mass of early career researchers explicitly connecting them with processes informing decision making. Most connections were created during the project and are still active. Researchers became advisers of local governments in a few cases.
- It consolidated the role of the WIoDER network – set up via previous IDRC grant – as one the main groups coordinating IRD's research on coastal resilience in the West Indian Ocean, creating institutional opportunities for future researchers within the IRD (master programs using IRD's core funds for to theses on subjects explored by WIoDER and DIDEM, for example).
- It formed the basis for larger investments on Research for Impact linked to the sustainability of the Oceans, in particular the Bridges initiative which stems directly from DIDEM: https://www.bridges-wio.com/
- It supported (not with IDRC funds) a process of revisiting the legal basis of the governance of the deep seas, and which takes into consideration how the health of ecosystems services provided by marine environments is linked to coastal and deltas areas. DIDEM is now part of the Regional Ocean Governance Strategy under the Nairobi Convention.
- It kick-started a series of "standing knowledge labs" where activities of IRD and partners continue and that are now part of the core research activities of IRD and all collaborating universities. Some of the project sites continue to be used as hands-on learning sites for local decision makers. The position of the DIDEM labs – which include the ones in deltas identified in green, are shown in the picture below:

## RESEARCH OUTPUTS

2. List up to 10 most important research outputs generated by the project. Where possible, provide the link.

Outputs are the directly achievable products of a project's completed activities (e.g. policy briefs, journal articles, research papers, trained people, etc.). Indicate the project outputs that were published on an open access basis. What, if any, outputs resulting from this project will be published open access beyond the duration of the project, and it is possible that the grantee will seek further IDRC support for this?

By design, DIDEM has been focusing on capacity strengthening, dissemination and dialogue between researchers and decision makers. Therefore, most of its tangible outputs are linked to knowledge brokering and sharing events. However, knowledge sharing has been supported by around 40 papers, theses and reports. About a third of the outputs were produced partially or entirely thanks to the IDRC funds (which were less than 10% of the total budget). Among them, the most important outputs related to the deltas' component have been so far:

- A permanent website https://www.didem-project.org/ with listed outcomes and outputs of the project.
- An impact, post impact and restoration assessment of the effects of large hydorecological dams influencing sediment dynamics and flooding regimes in West Indian Ocean Deltas, with implications for ecosystem services critical to food systems, are presented in a series of academic paper such as: Duvail, S. et al., "Jointly thinking the post-dam future: exchange of local and scientific knowledge on the lakes of the Lower Rufiji, Tanzania" (Open Access)
- A synthesis workshop in Mozambique which brought researchers and decision makers together to discuss how to optimize the management of flows of ecosystem services for poverty reduction. The work preceding the workshop is also at the basis of a large MOOC course under finalization.
- A full report on Environmental Flows for enhanced Biodiversity and poverty alleviation in the Incomati river delta, Mozambique, presented to the Mozambique Government and now inserted as reference documents of the Nairobi Convention (Open Access)
- Open Access data sets, like for instance the unprecedented one identifying all small islands into the Betsiboke Delta in Madagascar, which is now used both for conservation and land rights tracking purposes.
- Repositories of Open Access maps like the ones studying recurrent flooded areas in the Bestiboke river delta, which are now used by the Ministry of Agriculture of Madagascar to better anticipate areas that will become cultivable form one season to the other, and to reduce the risk of sand covering fertile land.
- Evaluations of the combined impacts of hydrological change, coastal dynamics and human activity on ecosystems services, such as mangrove cover and health in the case of Tana River delta, Kenya (Open Access)
- Early career researchers' theses – like this one analysing the temporal evolution of the delta of Tana river, Kenya – that proved to be a step up in the research capacity of students in all four countries where the delta component of DIDEM has been working; or a study of the downstream impacts of river damming on the ecosystems services at the bases of food systems in the Rufiji Delta in Tanzania.
- The Kenya team produced and shared videos on the activities of their living lab, such as: "Efforts to mitigate salinization of the Tana delta" long https://youtu.be/-kkE5SlvTMc and short version https://youtu.be/rCSIDd11K54

- Peer reviewed research papers such as Evaluating the combined impacts of hydrological change, coastal dynamics and human activity on mangrove cover and health in the Tana River delta, Kenya.

Even though project 109281 ended, the DIDEM collaboration continues, and other outputs are under preparation.

3. If appropriate, explain why outputs were not completed or were of poor quality.
Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

In the overall, outputs have been high quality, despite differences due to the diversity and size of teams, institutions, and maturity for the fields of research probed by the project. A fairly large number of peer reviewed scientific papers (~10 out of which at least 3 from the river deltas component) are still in the works, with some delay compared to the original work plan. Delay was mostly determined by the fact that the various components of the project started at different times, while several deliverables and outputs are the results of collaborations across components.

The team aims to present the results at the June 2025 UN Ocean Conference in Nice, France. The conference promises to give high visibility to the work, and it could be an opportunity for highlighting the work of other initiatives funded by IDRC and linked to the Blue Economy, to coastal adaptation and resilience, and to sustainable aquaculture.

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?
Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

The work was important to fund because it created a critical mass of initiatives that are now informing decision making in the West Indian Ocean. The project also responded to a call for action coming from the member states of the Nairobi Convention, and the results contributed to mobilize more investment of France in the West Indian Ocean in terms of research for sustainable development, which is now reflected in the Bridges-WIO program under France2030. When at full regime, Bridges-WIO aims to be roughly one order of magnitude larger than DIDEM in terms of budget.

The general objective of DIDEM lied in between the sphere of influence and the sphere of impact of the project, and fully reaching it will depend on the long-term sustainability of the work that DIDEM initiated. However, there is a good indication that the project set onto a good pathway, for example with some of the reports and databases now used routinely by local governments in the region of the Incomati river, Mozambique, or in Betsiboke, Madagascar, and in Comoros islands (this last part not a component funded by IDRC, but with a common methodology of participation of decision makers, experimented in the standing living labs). At least one report is also routinely accessed by the members of the Nairobi Convention, that DIDEM had set out to inform. The component working on the governance of the high seas (also not directly funded by IDRC) was able to discuss a new legal framework that is now under consideration by the Nairobi Convention and its member countries.

5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC·CRDI

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

The results are in line with what was originally expected. Many of the results informed conversations and negotiations on opportunities to increase the resilience of connected ecosystems in the West Indian Ocean that are either at a very localized level (individual municipalities in deltas or in several part of the Comoros islands, for instance), or Regional (informing the work of the Nairobi Convention, and of a transnational regional governance of high seas). Nevertheless, these two levels face now different challenges in terms of sustainability in time:

- Local processes are threatened by turnover of stakeholders, or by more urgent problems communities must face. For example, the recent devastating impact of cyclone Chido on Mayotte turned the attention of local authorities in neighboring Comoros away from long-term coastal soil erosion elicited by the work of DIDEM.
- Regional processes, in turn, need a very long time to fully develop, beyond the life of DIDEM project.

National policies – on the other hand – have largely been out of the focus of DIDEM. This was a weakness of the project, but it was expected given the composition of the team and the existing direct connections between researchers and decision makes, which were richer in the two levels described above.

## 6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.

Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

The project was implemented under the 2030 Strategy period, but it was fully developed during the previous Strategic Plan, so it is aligned with the 2015-2020 priorities. The work contributed to all three strategic objectives of the plan as:

- It continued to generate knowledge and evidence on a more sustainable management and governance of coastal and marine ecosystems. (obj.1)
- It contributed to the growth of a critical mass of early career researchers participating in drafting new natural resources management plans with local authorities (obj.2)
- It positioned the West Indian Ocean Development and Research network, created by IDRC, as a key element of a larger partnership which included other funders (obj 3).

Comment: DIDEM gave multiple examples of co-creation of knowledge with communities, via living labs, activities in schools, and dialogues between beneficiaries and early career researchers.

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

Some Lessons learned: the parallel funding mechanism that supported DIDEM was never formalized into a partnership among donors. This made things easier at the project approval stage, but:

- There was no formal agreement on roles and responsibilities among funders, especially in the way to receive and approve reports. This determined a few problems that are described in the Strategic Considerations below, including final delays with the financial reporting.
- A proper donors' collaboration table that could have promoted more work was never open, mostly for the lack of interest of FFEM. Although this door may still be open, it would require additional effort after the end of the project.

When supporting projects of a certain budget size (~3m Euro in the case of DIDEM) it may be worth insisting on a clearer agreement among funders right from the start, and to substantiate the request with a larger financial contribution coming from IDRC, when possible.

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

The PAD and the project development discussions had identified the following risks:

Security issues in some of the river deltas, and in the Tana (Kenya), Rufiji (Tanzania) and in general in Mozambique. Security incidents had had an impact on some of the project activities of the founding phase of the WloDER network (project 108535), although they had not jeopardized the objectives and ultimately there had been no negative consequences on team members nor on beneficiaries. DIDEM monitored this risk, with fortunately no impact during the project. The increased impact of tropical cyclones had also been underestimated. However, the relatively safe field site in Mozambique (Incomati river, close to Maputo, less affected by northern insecurity and extreme weather events) and the close collaboration of the Eduardo Mondlane University with local authorities reduced impact and delays to the minimum.

Complexity of the partnership – both of funders and implementing organizations: The larger DIDEM project was the result of eight (8) financial contributions coming from FFEM, IDRC, Société Explorations de Monaco, Fondation de France, UNEP, UNDP, IRD itself and the Republique Française via regional funds to the Département de la Reunion.

The complexity of the partnership brought some risks that were identified but not fully understood, even by IRD.

- Even though each funder covered in principle an independent component of the project, many activities turned out to be correlated and synergetic. However, each funder kept their own schedule – with the notable exceptions of Explorations Monaco and IDRC – when it came to reporting and some insisted on keeping different reporting templates also for the technical part of the project. This created delays and difficulties in monitoring activities, deliverables and outcomes. As a mitigation strategy, DIDEM – in consultation with IDRC – managed to set up a project steering committee made of funders' representatives, as a forum for regular updates Comite de Pilotage). IDRC also granted a no-cost extension to the component on river deltas to better align their activities with the rest of the project, which started almost one year later except for a small set of activities funded by Explorations Monaco.

- The relative weight of different funders was evident throughout the project, with FFEM being responsible for ~80% of the budget and IDRC controlling a mere 10%, which made the Centre the second donor for importance but still prevented IDRC from having the influencing power of FFEM. FFEM had different reporting needs especially in terms of timelines for receiving reports, which were much more relaxed than the ones of IDRC. Since IRD, the main implementing organization and direct recipient of all financial contributions, has a centralized financial administration procedure, it followed the requests of FFEM, and this delayed considerably the final technical and financial reporting despite what indicated in IDRC's Grant Agreement with the recipient. It is to be noted that FFEM and IDRC remained aligned of the research priorities and kept cordial relations during the project.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the

project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

N/A

## Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

A large and complex project, in its entirety (all donor contributions) and well recorded through this PCR.

It is worth IDRC learning more from this and preparing for more for such collaborations with other donors where we may not be driving coordination, nor in formal agreements with the other partners. Complex and chaotic as it may seem, IDRC can contribute valuably and influence agendas by being part of bigger initiatives, bringing our flexibility and preparedness to work more closely with grantees on locally driven processes, outputs and coordination efforts; even with relatively smaller financial contributions.

I was previously largely unaware of this project, so am pleased that my attention has been raised about such a productive and potentially impactful and longer lasting initiative.

I am pleased to approve and close this stage of the project.
