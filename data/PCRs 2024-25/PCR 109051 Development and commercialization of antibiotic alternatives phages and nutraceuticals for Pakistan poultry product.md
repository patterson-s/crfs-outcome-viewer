# Project Abstract

In the past two decades, Pakistan poultry production has undergone tremendous modernization, and the country currently ranks as the 8th largest poultry producer in the world. While impressive, there is growing concern over the use of antibiotics in the country's poultry production system. As in other countries with modern poultry production systems, these concerns center on the potential impact that overuse or misuse of antibiotics in poultry production and associated antibiotic resistance could have on public health. Thus, the need for novel, effective, and affordable alternatives to traditional antibiotics is abundantly clear. Developing such alternatives for poultry production is arguably more complicated, however, as the drugs are used for wide-ranging purposes (treatment, prevention, and improved growth) and the resulting increased efficiencies are a powerful production tool where there are very low margins.

The research team will develop new technologies that will collectively replace the benefits of antibiotics in poultry production in Pakistan. The consortium's objectives are two-fold: 1) design and implement platforms that allow rapid development of phage- and nutraceutical-based antibiotic alternatives that alone, or in combination, limit bacterial infections and improve growth; and 2) comprehensively define a framework, based on research that facilitates the commercial and clinical introduction of these technologies in Pakistan poultry production. The project will result in the reduction of reliance on antibiotics in Pakistan poultry production and a transition to alternatives that enhance poultry health and efficiency without a concomitant risk to public health. The research team expects to produce nutraceuticals from agro-wastes and a cocktail of phages used in combination against major bacterial threats to Pakistan poultry.

# PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

- This innovative research project has created two polyphage prototypes that significantly reduced colonization of *Salmonella Gallinarum* and avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC), respectively, in chickens; two provisional patent applications have been filed corresponding to the two prototypes and are in preliminary conversations with two Pakistani companies interested in licensing the technologies; moreover, the team at the end of their project created a regulatory approval roadmap specific to Pakistan.

- The research team developed an attenuated deletion mutant (ΔSpvB-ΔSSau) strain of *Salmonella Gallinarum* that provided significant challenged against virulent *Salmonella Gallinarum* infection when used as a vaccine in broilers; in addition the team developed recombinant phages equipped with CRISP/Cas9 targeting virulent genes (SpvB and SSau) of *Salmonella Gallinarum* which effectively reduced the colonization of *Salmonella Gallinarum* and reduced 50% mortalities in challenged chickens compared with challenged but untreated chickens;

- Additionally, the team developed and optimized an eco-friendly, cost-effective extraction process to extract bioactive compounds from mango waste including peels and seed kernels using ultrasound-assisted extraction; and found that supplementing chicken feeds with mango seek kernel extract (optimized UAE) may enhance chicken growth.

- Estimably, the team showed that Pakistani consumers not only accept the use of bacteriophage therapy in poultry production but are willing-to-pay higher prices for poultry products from birds receiving bacteriophages in place of antibiotics;

- Regarding the outcome, commercialisation, the team filed two patents to licence their developed technologies. This is a step towards creating a prototype product. The project has also created a regulatory roadmap, meaning that the foundations of a product have been established. It is also worth mentioning that the project has been selected to progress to Phase 2.0, in which they will continue to work towards commercialisation.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC·CRDI

This was an early-stage project, carried out in a partnership between Purdue University (USA), Punjab University (Pakistan) and Sargodha university (Pakistan) that aimed at discovery and proof of concept. The overall goal was to ensure the sustainability of Pakistan poultry production through the development of antibiotic alternatives that are highly functional in a Pakistani context. The project succeeded to:

- Develop a high-throughput phage isolation and characterization system to target the most critical current and emerging bacterial pathogens in Pakistan poultry production;
- Design nutraceutical-based alternatives able to replace the growth promoting capacity of antibiotics in Pakistani poultry;
- Provide a research-based roadmap defining the barriers to entry into the marketplace, specifically regulatory, economic, and social challenges that must be addressed to bring these developed technologies to practical use in Pakistan.
- File two provisional patent applications based on these results. The first application focuses on the use of our Salmonella Gallinarum prototype to prevent or control Salmonella Gallinarum infections in poultry. The team is in preliminary talks with two Pakistani companies interested in licensing the technologies. The technologies will also be promoted at this year's Internation Poultry Expo in Lahore, Pakistan, which draw 1000's of academics and poultry industry leaders each year. The second application focuses on the use of our APEC prototype to prevent or control colibacillosis in poultry.

5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

The project outputs were in line with what was expected.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.

Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

Large-scale positive change:

This project is an early-stage discovery project aiming to develop a proof-of-concept on the potential use of two polyphage prototypes that significantly reduced colonization of Salmonella Gallinarum and avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC), respectively, in chickens. Although the project's impact on smallholder beneficiaries may not be immediate, It addresses the important issue of the lack of innovative alternative solutions to antimicrobials to achieve some of IDRC's development outcomes, especially 'improving health for all'. This project specifically seeks to develop novel technology based on bacteriophages interventions that are challenging to scale-up and convert into a commercial product. Phage technology represents probably the most affordable antibiotic alternative, which is extremely attractive and challenging at the same time for use in low- and middle-income countries. The research project, therefore, contributes to the "enhancing food and nutrition security" development outcome by reducing animal losses from disease and contributing to a sustainable poultry system for the future.

Supporting leaders of today and tomorrow:

This project improved the technical capacity of the Pakistani investigators in phage technology development, especially in the poultry sector. The project includes three research institutions two are from LMIC (Pakistan) and one from USA. All three PIs are highly qualified in phage selection, preparations, formulations and development. Through this project and especially in Pakistan where amazingly high number of post-docs, PhD students and undergrad students: training of 28 graduate students (five [4 MS, 1 PhD] at Purdue; eight [6 MS, 2 PhD] at University of the Punjab and sixteen

[9 MS, 7 PhD]) at University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences/ University of Sargodha and sixteen [9 MS, 7 PhD]). Highly training was offered to these future leaders on phage technology development, broilers health, and clinical trials. Additional lab and research technicians participated directly in the research, which helped them acquire the research skills needed in scientific research.

## Partner of Choice:

This project was funded through a donor-partnership program comprising IDRC and the UK Government's Global AMR Innovation Fund (GAMRIF) – managed by the UK Department of Health and Social Care. In addition, the InnoVet-AMR Call for Proposals encouraged effective partnerships across the public and private sectors to coordinate better discovery, development, and sustainable delivery of the proposed veterinary solutions. The research teams had to include at least one researcher from an institution based in a low- and middle-income country as principal investigator or co-applicant. This project highlights the strengths of IDRC in supporting private sector engagement strategy. This project engaged 3 research institutions: Research Institution 1: Purdue University Country/Region: USA, North America. 2: Research Institution 2: Sargodha University. Country/Region: Pakistan, Asia. 3: Research Institution 3: Punjab University Country/Region: Pakistan, Asia. This project highlights the strengths of IDRC in supporting southern partners in exploring and delivering sustainable solutions to smallholder farmers' challenges in Pakistan. This project also offered the continuous opportunity for IDRC to partner with institutions in Pakistan and the Asian region. Indeed, the same team and project were selected for a second funding phase.

## FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC’s administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

The team demonstrated remarkable performance and responsiveness, effectively utilizing the allocated funds. It is one of the most actively engaged projects. Furthermore, the project was selected to progress to a second funding phase. It is worth noting that the project achieved its objectives, representing a valuable investment for IDRC.

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

- One of the anticipated risks was related to the nature of the exploratory product development project, which presents the probability of not reaching the expected outcome and is identified for all the InnoVet-AMR projects. The research teams have provided and implemented a risk mitigation plan that has allowed the project to proceed. The team provided detailed technical reports on time and was very keen to provide all the documents we thought necessary. In addition, the IDRC program officers overseeing the project have maintained regular communication with the research team via laboratory visits.

- The COVID global pandemic represented a significant unforeseen risk. The project encountered difficulties because of the interruption of activities during the pandemic, as well as the subsequent increase in the prices of laboratory products and consumables. This necessitated the acquisition of additional funds, personnel, and a revised project schedule. It is nevertheless noteworthy that the 18-month extension served to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.

- The team had proposed an international conference to showcase research in the area of antibiotic resistance in the Indian Subcontinent. However, the conference was not hosted due to timing and logistical issues. This is reflected in the underspend in the last financial reporting. In Phase 2 funding, the team will implement more effective outreach initiatives.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

The project has not raised any ethic related issue.

## Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

This project was one of eleven IDRC funded projects which were developed through the Innovative Veterinary Solutions for antimicrobial resistance (InnoVet-AMR), a partnership with the UK Department of Health and Social Care (UK-DHSC). The objective of this initiative was to develop alternatives (including vaccines) to antibiotics in the veterinary sector. This project was 1 of 2 focusing on developing bacteriophage as alternative to antibiotics in the poultry sector. The project is based in Pakistan. One key specificity of the project is that in addition to developing bacteriophage, it also developing a nutraceutical using waste of mangoes (seeds and kernels). One interesting aspect of the project is that they established an Industry Advisory Board including Industry and government with participation of women members. The research team was fairly gender blind at the beginning of the project but really made strides in their understanding of gender issues by the end of the project.

The focus of the InnoVet-AMR 2.0 was to develop new products and therefore a series of training opportunities was developed by IDRC to accompany the research teams in the product development process toward commercialization. This project was close to reaching proof of concept; this was one of the main indicators of success of the InnoVet-AMR program. Before finalizing the project and the program, a new phase has been negotiated with the UK-DHSC, InnoVet-AMR 2.0. A component of this new program is to continue funding the projects of InnnoVet-AMR1.0 within a second phase. This project was selected to receive further funding in this new phase of funding and will therefore be able to pursue its development toward a successful full proof of concept.

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project and to formally approve the report and its contents.

The project's performance against its first outcome has been very well described, while the performance against towards the second outcome, which leads to greater uptake and use was minimal. If there is additional evidence available on how the project's progress towards its second second outcome was, please elaborate more it: was the framework for commercialisation completed? How many Private Sector PS) actors were involved? What market linkages options (if any) were considered for connecting poultry farmers and PS?
