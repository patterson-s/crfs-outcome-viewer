## Project Abstract

Indonesia is one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters in the world, and its emission levels are projected to increase. The country's rapid economic growth has led to tremendous environmental changes, including pollution and contamination of inland and coastal waters, deforestation, overexploitation of resources, and loss of biodiversity, adversely affecting the quality of life and climate change adaptation capacity of the country's poorest, most vulnerable people. Knowledge gaps produced by inefficient institutional arrangements compound such adversity. These challenges impact Indonesia's ability to meet the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions established by the United Nations' Framework Convention on Climate Change. What is needed is coherent and systematic implementation and monitoring of evidence-informed climate policies and plans.

The Think Climate Indonesia initiative responded to these challenges by supporting Indonesia to meet climate-mitigation commitments and engage in climate-adaptation actions by supporting independent-policy research organizations (i.e., think tanks) to undertake high-quality research, communicate evidence, and engage policy audiences and communities on climate change. Three work packages composed this initiative: (i) organizational and research-capacity strengthening; (ii) research-pilot-projects implementation addressing climate mitigation and adaptation; and (iii) collaboration and engagement through peer learning and policy dialogues.

The initiative supported five Indonesian think tanks—Yayasan Kaleka (Kaleka), Yayasan Kota Kita Surakarta (Kota Kita), Partnership for Governance Reform (Kemitraan), Pusat Telaah Dan Informasi Regional (PATTIRO), and the World Resource Institute Indonesia (WRI). These think tanks were selected through an open competitive call processed from December 2018 to January 2019. This initiative is supported by a partnership between the International Development Research Centre and the Oak Foundation.

Note : This PCR includes five projects.

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

I. Knowledge generated collaboratively with relevant local and national actors and disseminated: Through their collaborative applied research, policy analyses, and alliance-building, the five think tanks have completed their research projects and provided conclusions and ways forward towards better climate adaptation and mitigation in Indonesia. They generated evidence to propose and test solutions to the challenges of environmental degradation and rural poverty across districts and provinces and at different scales. The methodologies used combined, among others, literature reviews, focus groups, in-depth and semi-structured interviews, spatial analyses, biodiversity surveys, vulnerability assessments, direct observations in the field, case studies, and climate budget tagging. With over 500 presentations and outputs, the think tanks have put significant effort into dissemination, presenting the project through articles; research reports; websites; Instagram posts; forums; regional, national, and local conferences; workshops; and local media.

II. Final TCI policy dialogue "The Strategic Role of Civil Society Organizations and Youth in Promoting Climate Change Action in Indonesia National Elections 2024." October 12, 2023. The dialogue featured high-level decision-makers at the national government levels, politicians, a representative for the 2024 presidential and vice presidential candidates, youth representatives, CSO colleagues, academics, the Canadian Embassy, and members of the media, with a total of 116 participants who joined in person. Consisting of two panel discussions, the event delved into the critical role of civil society in driving climate change action and the urgency to engage Indonesia's younger generation to advocate for a climate agenda ahead of the National 2024 elections. It also included an exhibition to showcase TCI partners' accomplishments and results during the program.

As a result of the event, the Ministry of Development Planning requested a meeting with Kemitraan to share research findings, and Kemitraan received a request from one political party and one candidate president and vice president team to discuss how to insert environmental issues and climate change into the political agenda. TCI collaborative position paper The 2024 election Time for young people to mainstream climate change and movie The Point of No Return - YouTube were created and showcased as an advocacy tool to push the climate change agenda during the election. The position paper emphasizes the urgency of ensuring that future leaders are aware of and concerned about the issue of climate change and enables TCI partners to build a greater coalition and support youth aspirations beyond the TCI network.

III. Collaboration across the cohort and outside sustained beyond TCI: Prior to the start of this initiative, the five think tanks were unaware of each other and their shared mission to tackle climate change in Indonesia. The TCI initiative supported the design and implementation of collaborative activities, each led by one think tank in collaboration with the others (e.g., citizen science initiative, election position paper, youth camps, newsletter, policy brief writing training, Think Climate Forum dialogues, key capacity strengthening activities). These activities were selected and designed based on an assessment of the strengths and interests of each organization, building on their knowledge, expertise, and

research findings. The activities facilitated cross-cutting collaboration, a key objective of this partnership, to encourage think tanks to work collaboratively to identify data needs and develop knowledge to inform good policy. These activities have stimulated collaboration and helped think tanks connect with relevant stakeholders, strengthening the five think tanks' network of stakeholders (policymakers, academics, political parties, presidential candidates, NGOs, community groups, farmer organizations, schools, youth groups, etc.). In addition to the five recipients, about 14 organizations were directly involved as partners/third parties in TCI, meaning TCI now has a network of 20 organizations involved directly. Some examples of the cross-cutting collaboration:

- MoUs have been signed with the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Environment and Forestry, Ministry of National Development Planning (Bappenas), Fiscal Policy Agency-Ministry of Finance (BKF-MoF), and Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA), ensuring the data will inform policies.
- Four Muda Melangkah Youth camps (Youth on the Move) were organized collaboratively to provide knowledge, guidance, resources, and assistance for youth to catalyze local climate movements across four provinces: Bukittinggi, West Sumatra; Takengon, Aceh; East Kalimantan; and North Jakarta. This program allowed young people (between 18 and 24 years old) to participate actively in discussions, workshops, and training on environmental and climate crisis issues. This included camps on gender issues and local land-use decision-making; social forestry and food systems; social forestry and youth participation; training on citizen journalism; management, campaign, and organizational skills; and governance, democracy, and corruption. These camps are in high demand and requests have been made to hold the camp beyond TCI.

Muda Melangkah Youthcamp

- "Think Climate Forum" dialogue series aimed to advance conversations on research findings and potential solutions in addressing climate resilience among diverse stakeholders, including think tanks, policymakers, academics, and civil society organizations. With more than 500 participants, it successfully encouraged concrete collective actions and fostered a shared learning space to accelerate collaboration among TCI partners as well as key stakeholders from government, civil society, academia, communities, etc. For examples, see the following links:

Think Climate Indonesia Partners Kick-Off TCI Forum with a Dialogue on GESI in Indonesia's Climate Actions

![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)
Mon, 12 Sep 2022. Mon, 27 Jun 2022

- "Citizen Science initiative" increased farmers' climate awareness and literacy through the implementation of a Citizen Science research program, which involves farmers in the collection of climate change data in five districts. Farmers use thermo-hygrometers, ombrometers, and high-resolution cameras to collect primary data on temperature, rainfall, humidity, changes to farming lands, and the width of water bodies. Data is shared with the wider community through the Garda Climate platform, which has had a positive response from farmers and currently has 41 members. This initiative aimed to empower farmers to adapt to the impacts of climate change through a planting calendar calculation and help selecting varieties and handling pests. This initiative generated a new partnership with the Agency of Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics, who provided trainings and field schools. The climate field schools improved INOBU's network of local partners' skills in collecting and analyzing data, adopting a training-for-trainer's approach.

IV. Integrated GESI in research and within their organizations: All five think tanks integrated GESI in organizational policy and program implementation and integrated a gender lens in research and program design. Project teams and partners aimed to have fair representation of women, gave priority to women in activities and trainings, conducted studies specifically on women, and encouraged organizations they worked with to include women. They invited gender experts to review research methodologies to ensure GESI considerations were addressed, applied GESI to internal operational systems such as recruitment and procurement, integrated GESI into new proposal development, and added gender activities to existing projects. For example:

- Kemitraan conducted a series of GESI trainings for staff to enhance their GESI policy; developed a concrete gender action plan to guide them in implementing GESI; developed an e-learning platform to ensure capacity building for all employees; created basic gender training modules, including sex and gender, gender injustice, gender equality and patriarchy, and gender mainstreaming; and integrated GESI into their project tracking system to monitor how program activities have applied a gender lens.

- Kota Kita staff participated in a series of capacity-building activities focused on gender equality, disability, and social inclusion, including an introduction to gender mainstreaming, a gender assessment of the organization, intensive internal capacity-building activities on gender mainstreaming, and gender coaching sessions.
- WRI developed a module, based on the gender module developed by the TCI project, that helped them better integrate gender into new proposals and add new gender activities in other projects with the goal to mainstream gender issues in the National Plastic Action Partnership (NPAP) and its implementation, as well as in the Cities for Forest project in Papua and in city-wide spatial planning. The TCI module also helped the Indigenous and Livelihoods program develop a safeguard for social forestry.

V. Strengthened their capacity to generate and disseminate locally relevant and evidence-based research to inform policy for climate resilience. A total of 395 individuals (215 females and 180 males) were trained across the five think tanks and their partners. The think tanks engaged in a wide variety of capacity development activities (over 100) to improve: Communications capacities (e.g., using social media to engage additional stakeholders on climate change policy agenda); monitoring, evaluation, and narrative-building strategies; research-writing and research-presentation skills (e.g., to academic, policy, and public audiences); core think tank functions (e.g., research processes, ethics protocols, and structured peer-review seminars); organizational management (e.g., human-resources-integration systems, financial management, and administration policies); and fundraising capacities and funding-diversification strategies, with medium- to long-term sustainability, for expanding climate policy.

Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

All the anticipated outputs were completed. The diverse range of outputs such as scientific publications and communication products demonstrate that the research integration project delivered more outputs than originally anticipated. For example, the e-book was not one of the targeted deliverables. Additionally, some outputs, e.g., communication products, were disseminated widely to different users through Instagram, TCI newsletters, funding partner websites, and various social media campaigns, to mention but a few.

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

## 4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

## Kota Kita

Title: Climate Foodprint in Indonesian cities

Location: Jakarta and Solo Raya cities

## Research Findings:

Kota Kita provided insights into urban food systems and their interactions with climate change. They examined urban food accessibility and coastal communities, urban informalities and alternatives, and the dynamics of the urban food system during Ramadan. Key findings highlighted the significant consumption of food in urban areas, high food-related costs for low-income communities, barriers to food accessibility, the essential role of informal actors, the high adaptability of food informalities, and the adverse impacts of climate change on food production and livelihoods.

## Conclusions:

The research emphasized integrating food security into city planning and climate policies, strengthening rural-urban links to minimize food loss and waste, and adopting greener technologies such as bikes for food delivery.

## Results:

- Established the Urban Citizenship Academy to engage young leaders in addressing urban challenges.
- Collaborated with over 50 civil society organizations on urban food systems and research in three cities.
- Strengthened partnerships with city governments through research initiatives.
- Provided comprehensive recommendations to city governments for promoting sustainable urban food systems, integrating food systems into urban planning, and developing climate adaptation/mitigation plans.
- Engaged in regional networks and global discussions to amplify the impact and dissemination of research findings.

## Kaleka

Title: Sustainable agroforestry practices to enable smallholder farmers and forest dependent communities to enhance their livelihoods while protecting forests and biodiversity

Location: Mentawai District (West Sumatra Province), Sikka District (East Nusa Tenggara Province), Fakfak District (West Papua Province), Seruyan and West Kotawaringin districts (Central Kalimantan Province), Buton District (Southeast Sulawesi Province), Tanjung Jabung Barat District (Jambi Province)

## Research Findings:

Kaleka's research found: (i) Climate change has a significant impact on the productivity and production costs of oil palm farming; women farmers manage family resources but men continue to make decisions; and women farmers maintain livelihoods through diversification, extensification, and intensification of agriculture. (ii) Farmers have not been able to overcome the

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC·CRDI

effects of climate change, climate information is a significant factor in farmers' decision-making, and gender and education are highly influential factors. (iii) In Indigenous communities, climate change is impacting livelihoods, women are no longer able to predict weather; women farmers lack education, training, and innovation; and farmers produce only enough to meet their daily needs. (iv) Climate change makes it difficult for coconut farmers to determine planting times, the quantity and quality of coconut products has decreased, and farmers are adapting by planting short-term crops to increase household income. Key findings highlight the significant impact of climate change on smallholder farmers and vulnerable communities.

## Conclusions:

The research underscored the urgent need to integrate climate resilience into policy and practice, emphasizing the importance of sustainable farming systems and community resilience-building efforts.

## Results:

- Developed the Tertata platform, an integrated database system for managing climate data and research results. This platform aims to provide comprehensive information on climate change to both internal stakeholders and the public.
- Established the Kolibri alliance, comprising local nonprofit organizations, to promote sustainable farming practices and forest conservation, mainly targeting vulnerable groups such as women and youth. The alliance serves as a networking platform for civil society organizations to enhance sustainability efforts.
- Conducted climate field schools and citizen science programs to educate stakeholders and encourage community involvement in climate data collection and reporting.
- Integrated Tanabaik and Garda Iklim into a comprehensive platform for managing and disseminating knowledge on agriculture, environment, and youth. This all-purpose site provides communities with better access to climate-related information and facilitates collaboration with Info-BMKG for enhanced weather data access.
- Over 120 smallholder farmer, 50% women, were empowered and trained on sustainable food production. Activities and trainings included farming input assistance on pests and pesticide; farming-related trainings on fertilizer making, fertilizing techniques, and types of organic fertilizers; organic farming; cooperative management; agricultural practices for coconut, cocoa, vanilla, vegetables, and spices; and regular monitoring and coordination.

## PATTIRO

**Title:** Forest and Land Rehabilitation Program: Implications for smallholder farmers' local livelihoods and mitigation commitments

**Location:** Kutai Timur and Berau districts (East Kalimantan Province)

## Research Findings:

PATTIRO increased understanding of forest and land rehabilitation (RHL) and strengthened climate change action in the forestry sector to understand the implementation of RHL, how effective it has been at mitigating climate change, and how it has impacted communities living around forests. The research indicates that efforts to do RHL are hampered by the unclear roles of government agencies, overlapping and complex RHL regulations, rigid budget administration, and weak monitoring and evaluation. RHL implementation has demonstrated uneven economic benefits for communities. RHL would be more effective if it (i) involved the community in the process of planning, monitoring, evaluating, and maintaining plants in RHL; (ii) built a solid Forest Farmer Group to ensure sustainability; and (iii) gave forest farmer groups the rights to economic benefits from rehabilitation activities. Key findings highlighted the discrepancy between national RHL targets and actual achievements and the effectiveness of regional financing or local government budgets in RHL implementation.

## Conclusions:

The research identified several recommendations to strengthen RHL implementation, including regulatory enhancements, optimization of regional management agencies' roles, and improvement of monitoring and evaluation systems.

# Results:

- Initiated the formation of Pelita, a youth community in East Kalimantan, to promote climate change action through media campaigns, book writing, and participation in forums. Engaged 25 youth from diverse backgrounds and facilitated connections with NGOs and local media.
- Advocated for an RHL policy prioritizing community involvement, particularly in social forestry areas, through a government circular letter.
- Advocated for the allocation of the Revenue Sharing Fund for the Reforestation Fund of East Kalimantan province to finance RHL by social forestry groups.
- Promoted the use of an inclusive and sustainable RHL management model among stakeholders.
- Facilitated stakeholder meetings to discuss climate change policy, particularly regarding RHL’s role in emissions reduction and livelihood improvement.

# Kemitraan

**Title:** Crafting climate financing policy at subnational scales in Indonesia: An emphasis on low-emission agriculture and food security

**Location:** National and subnational

# Research Findings:

Kemitraan's Climate Budget Tagging Study (CBT) and Climate Resilience Governance Assessment revealed that the central government is primarily responsible for policies related to climate change but decentralization policies limit its authority over local governments and the absence of clear national policies hampers local policy formulation on GHG emissions reduction. Key findings highlighted that local government budget allocations for climate resilience programs need to be higher, more resources are needed for mitigation efforts, and the budgetary focus on food safety over food security and unclear implementation of gender policies pose challenges.

# Conclusions:

Local governance readiness to address climate change and disaster impacts falls within the absorptive capacity level, indicating coping and response capabilities. However, it needs more capacity to manage post-disaster functions effectively. The findings underscore the need for concerted efforts to comprehensively anticipate and manage longer-term risks and impacts.

# Results:

- Intensive stakeholder engagement led Pekalongan City and Central Java Province to make initial commitments to incorporate research findings into climate adaptation action plans.
- Bridged discussions between governmental entities, facilitating the dissemination of CBT technical guidelines and emphasizing the importance of integrating climate resilience issues into local development policies.
- The absence of climate change policies in assessed local governments spurred initiatives to develop climate adaptation policies and action plans.
- Collaborations with Mercy Corps and academics bolstered policy recommendations and facilitated the development of initiatives like the TCI Forum Dialogue and Youth Climate Camp.
- These initiatives expanded networking opportunities and provided input for political agendas.

# WRI-Indonesia

**Title:** The role of social forestry in climate adaptation and food security for smallholder farmers and forest dependent communities (including women and Indigenous communities)

**Location:** Kampar District (Riau Province), Rokan Hulu District (Riau Province), Islands of Meranti District (Riau Province)

# Research Findings:

WRI improved understanding of how the community-based social forestry (SF) program affects local food security with the aim to understand gaps and opportunities for climate adaptation and food resiliency following the implementation of SF. Historically, community-managed forests have supported local communities' food resilience, and this research confirmed that forests serve as a

--- Page 10 ---

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC·CRDI

potential food safety net. However, key findings highlighted that SF needs more prioritization in regional government policy and that, although forest management practices are to some extent in line with forest-based food security pathways, challenges include improving the value-added and market access of local forest products, incentivizing forest-based food subsistence with site-specific practices, and reducing the rate of forest loss.

## Conclusions:

Community participation and local conservation efforts are vital pillars in sustaining livelihoods and safeguarding against climate threats. However, significant policy and institutional reforms are imperative to better aligning conservation and food security objectives. The insights of this research hold the potential to catalyze a shift away from the prevailing discourse dominated by large-scale agricultural expansion towards a more community-centric approach to forest management. It is critical to recognize communities' ability to manage forest resources securely, particularly in a time of climate change, because food security is indispensable to efforts to foster the well-being of forest communities.

## Results:

- Made policy recommendations to local governments for implementing SF and customary forest rights.
- Encouraged stakeholders to adopt a localized gender narrative approach and embrace local cultural values, engaging women and youth.
- Participated in the Food and Land Use Coalition.
- Made recommendations for policymaking processes with the Ministry of Forestry and Environment, the Agency of Environment and Forestry Riau province, and various forest management units.
- Collaborated with NGOs, universities, and local and regional politicians with the aim to scale up research and apply lessons learned to other areas in Indonesia.

## 5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

This initiative approach relied heavily on meaningful collaboration between the five think tanks, and IDRC has seen a real network emerging that builds on each other's diversity, strengths, and network of stakeholders. Nevertheless, collaboration was the most challenging component, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic posed unprecedented and unforeseen challenges and frequent changes in COVID-19 restrictions in Indonesia had consequences for the timeline of grantees' fieldwork. The TCI initiative adapted to these challenging circumstances by adjusting offline activities to become online, moving to virtual platforms using IDRC's adaptive management approach, and adjusting grantees workplans. For instance, some desk activities and trainings planned for later in the initiative were moved ahead, allowing grantees to continue implementing their activities. Impressively, recipients also found clever and innovative ways to produce and disseminate their research despite restrictions on movement, travel, and gatherings, producing articles for the web, surveys, analyses, and presentations to inform civil society and policymakers during these trying times.

Despite immense challenges, there was also possibility: the expanded use of communication tools and strategies during the pandemic has resulted in stronger collaboration between the partners. While the virtual monthly meetings, virtual peer-learning events, and Kistorm virtual learning and exchange platform have been sufficient to create trust, working together briefly in a virtual space does not compare to working in-person over a longer time. So, IDRC created a chat group through WhatsApp to smooth the conversation and coordination. Even with the restrictions being gradually lifted, some of these tools offer a huge advantage and will remain important to our management of future projects in a hybrid post-pandemic era. Some learnings:

- A positive aspect of working in a virtual partnership is more effective discussions about methods of collaboration. Working face-to-face, you rarely discuss how things are going from

--- Page 11 ---

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC·CRDI

the point of view of communication and collaboration. Talking about how we work together, communicate, and operate is one of the benefits of virtual work.

- Establishing group cohesion or managing problems within a virtual cohort requires more time, greater availability, and more frequent meetings than face-to-face and therefore an increased workload. Before the pandemic, I relied on face-to-face interactions, both formal and informal, to understand the dynamics within projects and monitor them technically and financially. This situation forced IDRC to recreate such an atmosphere and informal links entirely virtually and using new tools.
- Virtual collaboration tools require technical support, generating costs that can be more significant than those of a face-to-face workshop. For example, the establishment of exchange and learning platforms, technical support and facilitators during workshops, data and document storage suites and file sharing based on the cloud, and remote tools for collecting climate data. These tools have generated new costs that must be considered in a hybrid world. IDRC needs to share knowledge of these tools in order to target the appropriate consultants according to our needs and to manage the costs, as these tools will remain in our management of future projects.
- It was essential to establish limited communication channels adapted to the Indonesian context. The collaborative tool options are numerous and, at first, we had too many channels, which discouraged communication and made it is easy to get lost between instant messaging programs, virtual walls or whiteboards, project management software (such as Asana), platforms, etc. Having a smaller number of well-defined channels maximizes participation, collaboration, and a sense of belonging.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic/core objectives?

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

The formal amendment of the co-funding agreement between the Oak Foundation and IDRC reflects the necessity of a no-cost 24-month extension for this initiative, which was required to accommodate the significant delays in obtaining country clearances and to provide teams with adequate time for project implementation. However, the delay in the signing of the donor agreement reduced the project duration from 36 to 34 months. The Oak Foundation requested a simplified process for the amendment of the agreement, but IDRC has mandatory internal processes and rationale. This misalignment between Oak's processes and IDRC's more ridged procedures created further delays, impacting the five partners. On the budget execution plan, a significant change was the transfer of the staffing funds to the Opportunities Funds. We agreed to an in-kind contribution of staff from IDRC but moved the funds from that line item to the Opportunities Funds. This allowed us to build on the opportunities of emerging project results.

Determining the full costs needed to cover a project remains a challenge for think tanks. This involves costs outside of the project itself, including human resource costs for highly qualified staff or infrastructure costs to maintain a building. Funder policies often cap indirect costs at 10–15% of total costs, but TCI experience showed that a minimum of 20% is required. This shortfall between actual or "real" costs and what is covered by projects is likely to continue, if not worsen, as projects with insufficient overhead funding, and costing that fails to cover administrative and research coordination functions, are becoming a larger portion of financial portfolios. Solutions to financing overhead costs are neither clear nor straightforward.

Core funding is a boon to think tanks, but its impact depends on the organization's internal and external context. Access to flexible funding allowed organizations to focus on their own priorities and gave them the ability to choose relevant research, organizational development strategies, and pathways to policy influence, leading to a strong sense of independence, stronger research capacities, enhanced internal systems, and increased capacities around communications and outreach.

The action-learning funding modality was one of the more successful elements of supplementary capacity-building support. Allowing think tanks to identify key peer-learning and capacity-building exercises meant more targeted trainings and encouraged learning from each other. This is partly a function of core funding, which enabled think tanks to invest in organizational strengthening. One example was the Opportunity Funds for collaboration between the think tanks, which allowed each organization to collaboratively design strategies to address its own priorities.

Positioning think tanks for influence through flexible funding arrangements that provide for organizational strengthening while reinforcing think tanks' independence means letting them set the agenda. Think tanks themselves are best situated to identify the areas they need to strengthen, just as they are best positioned to identify issues and entry points for influence—in consultation with policymakers and other key stakeholders. Think tanks and their funders, including IDRC, need to give more attention to the wider policymaking context, with an eye to building a healthy environment for civic debate and evidence-based policymaking. By bringing stakeholders directly into the research process, action research can enhance citizen participation while closing the gap between researchers and policymakers.

The think tanks need to continue to mobilize flexible support and funding to maintain their capabilities. They, and funders such as IDRC, should also recognize that communications, internal research coordination, human resource development, networking, and administration should be included and budgeted for in proposals and projects. TCI's other forms of support, such as training, technical assistance, and facilitating networking and collaboration, have been most effective when built around ongoing dialogue between the organizations' leadership and program officers. As TCI ends, the longer-term effects of core funding are still unclear. If senior researchers can be retained and key research coordination, financial management, and support to junior researchers maintained, prospects are good.

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

The risks highlighted in the PAD have been managed appropriately; however, the two-year delay in obtaining country clearance was an unanticipated risk that needed to be managed carefully to keep the partnership with Oak, requiring significant coordination and negotiation. The numerous virtual meetings between IDRC and the selected think tanks kept the recipients motivated during the long delay. This long wait, coupled with the imperatives and modalities surrounding initiative implementation, presented unique challenges and required significant coordination and negotiation as well as a contingency plan to manage risks.

During the wait, the think tanks invested significant time responding to requests from LIPI (now called National Research and Innovation Agency–BRIN), the Ministry of State Secretary, and the Ministry of Higher Education regarding the country-clearance process. They were invited to several events to present their proposals and provided evidence of their engagement with local governments and national universities. Following country-clearance obtention and the amendment of the co-funding agreement, numerous virtual meetings were held between IDRC and the five think tanks, both together and individually, to:

- Understand how the pandemic was affecting think tanks' activities and daily operations.
- Understand the priority changes within their respective organizations due to the long wait and how to adapt their original budget, workplan, and proposal.
- Discuss synergies and emerging opportunities for collaboration between the different organizations and amplification of individual project results.
- Present the new IDRC Strategy 2030 and the priorities of the new Climate-Resilient Food System division to discuss how to realign the initiative to ensure it meets new IDRC goals while keeping the original objectives and outcomes.

The think tanks all resubmitted an updated proposal, workplan, and budget, which were revised and approved by IDRC. The large number of actors involved, multiple levels of intervention, complex scientific and financial components, transdisciplinary nature of collaborations, and arduous formalizations required to understand the complex power relations between actors in Indonesia and Canada all made the period a challenging one with a steep learning curve.

## Director comments

The relevant Program or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

The Think Climate Indonesia (TCI) initiative, a collaborative effort between IDRC Centre and the Oak Foundation, exemplifies the importance of partnerships and shared learning. Despite a condensed project timeline from 36 to 34 months due to a delay in signing the donor agreement, the experience underscored the need for clear communication and the harmonization of processes. Compared with IDRC's thorough internal procedures, the Oak Foundation's request for a streamlined amendment process presented a learning opportunity. This scenario accentuated the significance of adaptability and alignment in donor partnerships, ultimately benefiting the five partners' collective work. Such challenges are not setbacks but stepping stones toward real collaboration and enhancing the impact of our collective efforts in development research.

TCI aimed to assist Indonesia in fulfilling its climate commitments by enhancing think tanks' capabilities and cooperation in conducting evidence-based climate change research. The initiative produced various research outputs, addressing challenges such as urban food systems, agroforestry practices, and climate financing policy. Collaboration was essential, involving governments, civil society organizations, youth groups, and media outlets. However, the project faced delays due to the country clearance process and the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring adaptive management and innovative solutions. Valuable lessons included the importance of core funding for the independence and strength of think tanks and the effectiveness of action-learning financing of peer learning and capacity-building. It also underscored the necessity for think tanks to consider the broader policymaking context and engage with stakeholders throughout the research process.

Core funding is beneficial for think tanks' independence and organizational strengthening. Access to flexible funding allowed organizations to focus on their priorities and choose relevant research, organizational development strategies, and pathways to policy influence, leading to a strong sense of independence, more substantial research capacities, enhanced internal systems, and increased capacities around communications and outreach. The action-learning funding modality was effective for peer learning and capacity-building. Allowing think tanks to identify key peer-learning and capacity-building exercises meant more targeted training and encouraged learning from each other. This is partly a function of core funding, which enabled think tanks to invest in organizational strengthening. One example was the Opportunity Funds for collaboration between the think tanks, which allowed each organization to collaboratively design strategies to address its priorities.
