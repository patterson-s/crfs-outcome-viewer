# Project Abstract

According to the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, for 30 years, Southeast Asia has been experiencing more frequent climate-related disaster events and an exponential increase in annual deaths. In addition to immediate economic and human losses, disaster affected populations experience long-term unemployment, poverty, health issues, and other effects, undermining communities' capacities to recover from disaster impacts and to cope with future events. Evidence from grey literature shows entrepreneurship is crucial to long-term community resilience and to reducing poverty, vulnerability, and disaster risk in communities moving toward recovery and reconstruction. Academic peer reviewed literature, however, has paid little attention to the role of social entrepreneurship, and there is almost no discussion of barriers inhibiting female social entrepreneurs from improving the well-being of communities reeling from climate-related disasters. Against this background and drawing lessons from the tremendous capacity of youth and women to drive change, this project aims to foster long-term community resilience to climate change in Malaysia and Cambodia. It will do so by empowering young female social entrepreneurs to develop disaster resilience plans via the use of both a geographical information system and crowdsourcing technology.

The project will conduct action-oriented research and capacity building activities via four pilots—three in Malaysia and one in Cambodia. The Malaysia sites comprise, respectively, coastal zone, floodplain, and highland areas in the State of Selangor Darul Ehsan. In Cambodia, the pilot will run in Kampong Speu Province, which reports drought, coastal hazards, groundwater shortage, and subsidence. To promote social entrepreneurship as an effective means of disaster risk reduction, the project will investigate fast- and slow-onset hazards specific to these areas. The project should positively impact 150,000 young women (20–40 years old), who will serve as catalysts to promote broader civil society engagement and to mobilize female social entrepreneurship in the development of disaster resilience plans in the four pilots. The plans will help the governments of these regions develop local disaster risk reduction strategies, which will, in turn, benefit 5.79 million people in Malaysia and 716,517 in Cambodia. The project will support implementation of Target E of the Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction and contribute to Sustainable Development Goal 13 on climate action. Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia will conduct the project in collaboration with the Geological Society of Malaysia (GSM), the Malaysian Disaster Risk Reduction Services Organisation (MDRRSO), and the Royal University of Phnom Penh in Cambodia.

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

- In Malaysia, funds were leveraged through the State Government to support researchers to integrate the project results and formulate the Selangor Policy and Action Plan on Climate Change. Key project findings were presented to the Chief Minister and Executive Council of the State Government of Selangor on February 24, 2022, and the Deputy State Secretary of Selangor State on July 21, 2022. A strong recommendation was made to integrate climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR) at the local authority level, highlighting the potential role of social entrepreneurs in this endeavour. Since then, the State Government of Selangor has provided separate funding of about RM 290,000 for the Project Leader to formulate the Selangor Policy and Action Plan on Climate Change, which is intended to coordinate state agencies and local authorities to implement climate resilient development. It is also an enabling vehicle for scaling-up local disaster resilience plans statewide, which could then be supported by social entrepreneurs in conjunction with the MyBahaya Platform (see below). This will also facilitate the linkage of Target E of the Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction and Sustainable Development Goal 13 on climate action.

- In Cambodia, project results serve as the basis for disaster resilience plans in the Kampong Speu Province, which has supported 59 agriculture cooperatives. The pilot study in Kampong Speu Province revealed that administrative boundaries are sufficient when developing susceptibility models for drought. The development of a drought susceptibility index (DSI) at the community level has enabled the delineation of areas for priority action. The new approach has been published in journals to inspire scientists from developing countries to be innovative in using the best available science. The information serves as the basis for disaster resilience plans in the Kampong Speu Province, where 59 agriculture cooperatives have the potential to become social entrepreneurs. Many of the cooperatives do not have a business plan. The Roadmap proposed for Cambodia, which includes a business plan, will be useful for transforming agriculture cooperatives into social entrepreneurships, in conjunction with the ongoing initiative of the World Bank in Cambodia to support the agriculture sector.

- Early and mid-career researchers empowered. The project included three PhD candidates, one master's candidate, and three interns. Researchers from the team have developed a higher level of confidence and leadership. For example, the Cambodia Team Leader Dr. C. Nyda obtained a full Professorship after publishing his project findings in high impact journals; project member Norazianti Asmari grew her enterprise (Geodata Services Resources) to conduct work beyond the project; graduate researcher Nurul Syazwani Yahaya increased her national profile and secured employment upon submitting her PhD thesis; and graduate researcher Navakanesh M Batmanathan secured funding to participate in the National Geographic Explorer Leadership Workshop, which took place in Hong Kong on May 22–26, 2023. Project members also had a collaborative meeting with members of the British Geological Survey on February 1, 2023, leading to a proposal application to the UK Tactical Fund. In addition, an off-shoot PhD project on the climate hazards and human mobility nexus, conducted by a women candidate funded by the Government of Malaysia, has commenced in the Kuala Selangor Pilot.

- MyBahaya Platform (MyHazards in Malay) was created, tested, and will be implemented beyond the project, including patenting of the product with the support of the British Geological Survey. MyBahaya is a community-based geographical information system (GIS) application to overcome constraints in obtaining data on climate, environmental, and socioeconomic stressors and to promote social entrepreneurship among early career female geologists in the region. Implemented by SEADPRI-UKM, Geological Society of Malaysia, Malaysia Meteorology Department (MMD), and Atlas Informatics and launched on November 7, 2023 at the 36th National Geoscience Conference by the Director General of the Mineral

and Geoscience Department of Malaysia, the web-based platform and crowdsourcing technology is designed to facilitate the collection of photo-based mobile crowdsourcing data to facilitate collection of early warning signs of geohazards such as landslides. In simple terms, users can snap photos of relevant features and incidents within their vicinity and upload the photos onto a centralized platform to be collected, stored, and processed for further use. This allows the public to participate in citizen reporting for signs of geohazard events. Geologists have an opportunity to embark on social entrepreneurship to support citizen science in DRR by scaling-up the MyBahaya Platform. Field-testing revealed that functions on the platform need to be expanded to include information on governance and response measures, in addition to multihazard susceptibility.

- Seed-funding was secured through a bilateral session with Integrated Research on Disaster Risk (IRDR) to discuss pathways for scaling-up products from the project. IRDR, an international scientific program co-sponsored by the International Science Council (ISC) and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), is in its second decade of operations. Seadpri-UKM, as an IRDR International Centre of Excellence for Disaster Risk and Climate Extremes (IRDR ICoE-SEADPRI-UKM), has leveraged opportunities to share project findings with this audience. With the seed-funding from the IRDR, project researchers will share tangible achievements in promoting social entrepreneurship with a broader audience beyond the project. In addition, lessons learned from conducting the project will be documented via the IRDR Working Paper Series and disseminated among the global disaster risk community.

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

See the three first points in Project Highlights for the key outcomes.

In addition, new knowledge was generated and disseminated through conferences and publications. Knowledge advancement in the four select pilots focused primarily on susceptibility modelling after conducting downscaling climate data and projections, parameterization and ranking, and assessment of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. The forecasting of fast- and slow-onset hazards using susceptibility modelling has yielded novel approaches for landslides, slope failures, coastal inundation, and subsidence. The integration of actions for near-term DRR and long-term climate change adaptation (CCA) is best if it is spatially contextualized using a collaborative approach with the participation of multiple stakeholders, including federal agencies, state governments, local authorities, nongovernment organizations, community leaders, and private sector representatives. In addition, the integration of DRR and CCA requires science inputs to be drawn within the same geomorphologic setting, i.e., coastal area, river basin, or sub-basin.

The project was designed in 2018 to be gender responsive, focusing on women social entrepreneurs. Empowering women was also addressed by actively targeting women's participation in the project team, capacity building, and outreach events. A majority of the project members, two of the three PhD candidates, the master's candidate in Cambodia, two of the three interns, and all seven of the short-term research assistants, were women. Women researchers were given equal opportunity to co-publish and present their work in events convened by the

project. In all the events organized by the project, women represented at least 35% of participants, though they represented more than 50% of participants for half of the events. In some events, women were exclusively targeted. In Malaysia, there was a perceptible change in the attitude of stakeholders, especially policymakers, toward the project. The initial lack of enthusiasm for a project that focused exclusively on women entrepreneurs has been replaced with acceptance. This is likely due to the increased socialization resulting from the current government's decision to ensure equal participation of women across the board for the civil service. In Cambodia, about 60% of the survey respondents were women, pointing to the almost equal gender representation of the agriculture sector in the country. Over 14 events were organized, including:

A poster of the event circulated via Academy GEX Facebook page and IDRC-funded project website, featuring all the invited speakers for the webinar.

# 5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

The initial focus was on four pilots, three in Malaysia and one in Cambodia, that investigated both fast- and slow-onset hazards specific to the four pilots. During implementation, comparative studies were conducted in both countries to improve the initial project design and refine findings and interactions. In Malaysia, the pilots comprised a coastal zone (Kuala Selangor), floodplain (Shah Alam), and highland area (Ampang Jaya), located in separate river basins in the State of Selangor Darul Ehsan. The integration of DRR and CCA required science inputs to be drawn within the same river basin to delineate context-specific actions at the local level. This required the inclusion of Kuala Lumpur (not originally planned), located along the Kelang River Basin, to link the floodplains of Shah Alam to the highland area of Ampang Jaya. Focus group discussions and interviews were conducted to gain insight on capacity requirement for social entrepreneurship and an understanding of challenges for governance of river basins across administrative boundaries. Crowdsourcing techniques were used to develop community-based

GIS applications to overcome constraints in obtaining data on climate, environmental, and socioeconomic stressors. Youths, at least 30% of the total population within each pilot, were the initial target group for crowdsourcing information on hazards specific to each pilot. However, due to the skill-set required to identify early warning signs of climate hazards in the field, early career professionals, specifically geologists, were identified as liaisons to supplement information provided by the community. In Cambodia, the Kampong Speu Province required the inclusion of Pursat Province for comparative purposes, which was not originally planned. Existing cooperatives in the agriculture sector were surveyed in both the pilot and the comparative study areas to determine their readiness for social entrepreneurship.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC’s strategic objectives?
Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.
Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

IDRC strategic objective 1 – Invest in knowledge and innovation for large-scale positive change

Using GIS and crowdsourced information, the project created new multihazard-forecasting knowledge that integrates DRR and CCA using hazards-susceptibility mapping and will be used to develop disaster resilience plans for selected communities. This innovative approach is intended to address unreliable regional climate projections and could be replicated at the local level in Malaysia, Cambodia, and other Southeast Asia countries.

The project positively impacted 100,000 young women (20–40 years old) who, as catalysts, promoted broad civil society engagement and mobilized women social entrepreneurs to help develop the four pilots’ disaster resilience plans. These disaster resilience plans supported the Selangor Darul Ehsan and Kampong Speu Province governments’ respective developments of local DRR strategies, which will benefit a further 5.79 million people in Malaysia and 716,517 in Cambodia. The project will support the Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction’s Target E implementation and contribute to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 13 on climate action.

IDRC strategic objective 2 – Build the leaders for today and tomorrow

See Highlight number 3.

IDRC strategic objective 3 – Be the partner of choice for greater impact

Project members had a collaborative meeting with members of the British Geological Survey on February 1, 2023, leading to a proposal application to the UK Tactical Fund. The project was implemented carefully to ensure value for money, effort, and funding. Additional resources and avenues are being sought for scaling-up the MyBahaya, including patenting of the product.

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC’s administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

The project was implemented carefully to ensure value for money, effort, and funding. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a delay in implementing the project. A one-year extension with no additional budget was approved by IDRC. The project has fulfilled its objectives—the scope and approach remain largely unchanged despite the revised timelines.

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

Besides COVID-19, no unanticipated risks affected the project.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

Research adhered to ethical standards to ensure the project protects all participants’ privacy, freedom, dignity, and integrity, including all aspects of major activities involving partner institutions and multiple stakeholder groups.

## Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

Click here to enter text.

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

The project, aligned with IDRC’s strategy on gender equality and supporting researchers from the Global South, created new multihazard forecasting knowledge that integrates Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) using hazards-susceptibility mapping. This knowledge can be replicated locally in Malaysia, Cambodia, and other Southeast Asian countries. The project positively impacted 100,000 young women, who served as catalysts to promote broad civil society engagement and mobilize women social entrepreneurs to help develop disaster resilience plans. Additionally, the project empowered early and mid-career researchers, especially women, to advance their skills and leadership. For similar future projects, it is recommended that women continue to be empowered and social entrepreneurship is promoted as an effective means of disaster risk reduction while expanding the use of GIS and crowdsourced information to create new multihazard-forecasting knowledge.

This project reminds us of the importance of continuing to focus on empowering women and promoting social entrepreneurship as an effective means of disaster risk reduction. We should also continue connecting technological innovations, such as the use of GIS and crowdsourced information, with gender equality approaches to continue building resilience to the climate crisis.
