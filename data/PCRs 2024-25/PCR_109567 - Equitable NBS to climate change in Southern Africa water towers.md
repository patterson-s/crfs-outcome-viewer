# Project Abstract

The widespread popularisation of nature-based solutions (NbS) through various northern-driven, high-level campaigns has raised concern amongst those working in the global South regarding the appropriateness of some NbS approaches in local contexts. This is especially true in Africa where many peoples' livelihoods are heavily dependent on water and landscapes and the multiple ecosystem services derived from these. Furthermore, the impacts of climate change on critical ecosystem services delivered by NbS or the plant species underpinning NbS are not yet fully understood.

Within this context, the Towards Equitable and Sustainable Nature-based Solutions in Southern Africa's Water Towers (TES NbS) project undertook interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research focused on the nexus of social equity, NbS and climate change.

Led by Dr Petra Holden at the African Climate and Development Initiative (ACDI) in the University of Cape Town, the project's aim was to promote greater awareness of opportunities, constraints and limits to NbS to support decision making, planning and implementation processes to achieve more equitable and sustainable NbS at local and national levels.

The project produced nine published guidance and communications products, with two guidance and communication products under development. Eight peer reviewed publications are due for submission in 2025. The project also produced two datasets that are fully open access. Two masters students graduated through this project, a third masters student will graduate in mid 2025 and a PhD student will graduate at the end of 2025.

The project has contributed to improved awareness and use of knowledge relating to social equity in NbS. Greater awareness and understanding of the importance of focusing on equity in NbS has been evidenced in policy processes, in practice and in the design of projects and international funding calls because of this project. The project has also increased capacity on the interrelated issues of NbS, climate change and social equity, particularly in Southern Africa. Professionals in various fields working on issues of social equity and NbS now have more knowledge and more robust skillsets, and the pipeline of capacity needed for equitable and sustainable NbS in Africa is growing. At the same time, the models and datasets that underpin an array of NbS- and climate change-related analyses in Southern Africa are increasingly becoming more appropriate, contextualised and powerful for decision-making as a result of this project.

# PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

This project was selected through a competitive closed-call in 2019 and was one of two exploratory investments made by IDRC into Nature-based Solutions (NbS) at the time. A notable element of this project is that it was led by an early career researcher (Dr Petra Holden) at the University of Cape Town. Active mentorship of Dr. Holden was built into the design, with the co-PI being a highly experienced professor (Dr Sheona Shackleton), who was committed to mentoring Dr Holden in the role of PI. IDRC's responsible officer also mentored Dr Holden in this process, with specific and additional guidance offered in terms of financial and technical reporting, influencing strategies and monitoring and evaluation.

This project produced new and internationally recognised insights into the intersections among social equity, sustainability and NbS. Importantly, through novel modelling techniques, the project produced new insights into the sustainability of NbS under future climate conditions, and through in-depth case study research and novel communications methods, the project has significantly raised awareness about equity considerations in NbS in the Southern African region and beyond. The project has also produced a new cadre of young professionals ready to take this work forward.

Below I highlight two of the key outcome areas of from this project.

Outcome 1: Improved use of knowledge relating to social equity and sustainability in NbS in national and international policy and research funding

TES NbS findings on the intersection among social equity, sustainability and NbS are novel and have been directly used in several national and international policy processes. For example, the South African delegation to the Convention on Biological Diversity used the TES NbS equity framework to frame their positions in the negotiations in both 2022 and 2024. Another example is South Africa's draft national research strategy for ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA), where, as a result of TES NbS input, 'equity outcomes' are now listed alongside benefits to people and desired ecosystem benefits in EbA-related goals in a recent national policy brief. Similarly, in 2023, the South African National Biodiversity Institute, a Green Climate Fund Direct Access Entity, requested input into their terms of reference for NbS projects on water security in South Africa.

The project's impact extends to international levels too. In early 2023, TES NbS findings were strongly used (and acknowledged) to inform a funding call for a UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) programme which was called 'NbS for equitable climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa'. The wider programme consisted of the Natural Environment Research Council, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), the Adaptation Research Alliance, and Loughborough University. This was a significant achievement as TES NbS effectively helped shape a next generation of international development research funded by organisations other than IDRC.

Outcome 2: Improved capacity to integrate social equity considerations in nature-based solutions

Throughout, the project strived to build the capacity of early-career researchers and students from Africa working on TES NbS, including three postdoctoral fellows, one PhD student, and three masters students. Wherever possible, project team members were offered professional development opportunities that could bolster their skills and networks beyond the TES NbS project. For example, Assumpta – an ecological mathematician postdoctoral researcher who worked on carbon and water modelling – said that her involvement in TES NbS has been "invaluable for [her] career development"; "This experience has improved my technical expertise

in land surface modelling, giving me the opportunity to contribute to regional needs in water resource management and global needs for carbon sequestration. I have been opportune to work alongside other leading scientists in this field enhancing my network of collaboration."

Improved capacity within the team has led to team members being increasingly viewed as experts on NbS and equity. For her work on NbS, Dr. Holden – an early career researcher and the PI of TES NbS – has received two awards including the AXA XL Climate Water Nexus Award and the Frontiers Planet Prize and was successful on two grant applications – one on equity and NbS in African cities funded under the CLARE programme, and one on climate services for sustainable NbS decision making and livelihoods funded under the European Union. In addition, and most notably, the work of TES NbS has provided the foundation for a new research lab at ACDI at the University of Cape Town purely focused on equitable and sustainable NbS for climate change adaptation and mitigation in Africa. Under the leadership of Petra (the PI of TES NbS), the People in Nature &amp; Climate Lab (PiNC Lab) was launched on 17 September 2024 at ACDI.

Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

The project exceeded expectations regarding outputs, in terms of both quantity and quality.

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?
Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

Key outcomes are shared in the project highlights section above. Here, I reflect on the project's contributions to the field of study and share some of the key scientific findings.

Nature-based solutions (NbS) are an often-touted solution to climate change that harness the contributions of nature and contribute toward human well being. However, Southern researchers have been warning for some time that ill thought-out NbS can transform land use, alienate local communities from their land, and that the solutions implemented might not even be feasible in the long run given future changes in climate. This study took a southern perspective on NbS as its starting point, and used interdisciplinary methods to ask substantive questions about the social equity outcomes and long term sustainability of nature-based interventions in the Southern African region.

The novelty of this study lies in two areas: First, in its exploration of the intersection among nature-based solutions, social equity and their long-term sustainability under future climate conditions. The high level of demand for project inputs into various policy processes (see Project Highlights) attests to the importance of this research area. Second, the project combined in-depth case study research with cutting edge land surface modelling and dynamic communications efforts, resulting in a holistic set of insights that are showing a high probability of impact in the academic and policy spheres alike.

Below I share 8 of the key findings of the project, together with figures and references to the publications associated with these findings.

Key finding 1: Across countries and NbS types, negative impacts and unequal benefit sharing can occur

Different groups, particularly in the global south, have described the negative and inequitable outcomes of NbS. Indeed, the project found 95 such examples in southern Africa, spanning multiple countries and NbS types (Figure 1).

Key finding 2: Even within the same context, NbS can deliver both positive benefits and negative impacts

Across the literature the project found examples of NbS delivering positive benefits for some and negative impacts for others even within the same context and same community. This was confirmed in case studies in the Eretsha Village and Umzimvubu Catchment. In both places, there was a wide variation of perspectives on benefits and impacts (Figure 2).

Key finding 3: Even NbS with equity-focused intentions do not necessarily lead to equitable outcomes

Many NbS projects that are framed as having equity-focused intentions – such as being collaborative, participatory or community based or focusing on those most vulnerable – still do not lead to equitable outcomes (Figure 3). There are different reasons for these equity-focused intentions not translating into equitable outcomes. In all cases deeper engagement with the contextual factors that can constrain or promote equity in NbS could have improved the equity outcomes at the local level.

Key finding 4. Inequitable outcomes happen in NbS because of factors that constrain social equity

Equitable intentions came up against various types of constraints to social equity which manifest across various scales, from social and gender norms at local scales, to biases and blind spots in funding and implementing agencies, some of which showed that equitable intentions were even a form of equity washing.

The project systematically synthesised these constraints to achieving social equity into nine main categories with 32 cross-cutting subcategories (Figure 4). This constraints typology provides an innovative and useful tool for practitioners and policy makers to ensure they acknowledge and address contextual equity when planning, designing or implementing nature-based solutions.

Key finding 5. The same constraints can impact different groups differently

In their case studies the project found that different groups experience different constraints in a variety of ways (Figure 5). They also found that although different social groups might describe the same category of constraints to social equity, the experience and impact of the constraint can differ.

The project also found that these constraints are not considered in multilateral NbS planning documents from southern Africa, and they found that project plans didn't even consider or only marginally accounted for contextual equity.

Key finding 6: Climate extremes are expected to be more severe and more frequent in Southern African water towers

Project projections indicated that Southern African water towers (the mountainous areas) will experience rising temperatures and higher potential evapotranspiration. Total rainfall is projected to be stable or decreasing. Even where total rainfall is not projected to change much, the pattern of rainfall is projected to shift. Rainfall events are likely to become less frequent, leading to longer dry periods. When it does rain, rainfall will be more intense with more frequent extreme-rainfall events. Changes are evident across global warming levels but are exacerbated at  $2^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ,  $3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , and  $4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . These changes in climate conditions will likely result in shifts in species composition and loss of biodiversity; it is likely that these changes point to increased flood, drought and fire risk, waterlogging and increased erosion and landslides, reduced soil moisture with impacts on crop or plant growth, water scarcity or heat stress.

Key finding 7: NbS should focus on native plant species that are most viable under future climate conditions

When working on NbS in a specific area, decisions about what plant species to use in the NbS are often based on which species are already growing in an area (i.e., for restoration) or which species are growing or can grow in an area (i.e., for misguided afforestation or agroforestry). But from the plant species modelling in this project, they found that, between the current climate conditions and a climate projected at  $2^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  of global warming, areas across southern Africa are predicted to experience a high turnover ( $10\%$  to  $\sim 20\%$ ) of plant species, with some species persisting, others

being lost, and new species moving in. The patterns of this turnover vary greatly across the region, and present different challenges and opportunities for different NbS types.

Key finding 8: There is no room for misguided afforestation efforts

Afforestation is known to have negative impacts on water, livelihoods and biodiversity (illustrated through Figure 8). Yet across southern Africa, it has been implemented or at least proposed under misconceptions about the amount of carbon that can be sequestered in forests versus grasslands, savannas and shrublands.

From this analyses of plant species turnover in southern Africa, the project found large proportions of southern Africa where alien tree species persistence will be low and where there will be more alien tree species lost than gained under climate change. Here afforestation will likely be unviable.

# A story about misguided tree planting in Madagascar

![img-9.jpeg](img-9.jpeg)
Working on the assumption that the Madagascar landscape was fully covered by forests before humans arrived, the government in Madagascar is conducting widespread tree planting. But contrary to this assumption, a palaeo-ecologist exploring the ecological history of the landscape found that it was always dominated by open and mosaic ecosystems. Talking with local communities, he heard that their farming and harvesting practices have long relied on open and woodland savanna ecosystems, and these practices are now compromised by the extensive "re"forestation campaign.

# 5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

The results originally anticipated in the project proposal have been achieved. At the output level, results related to academic and more innovative outputs (such as a digiBook and infographics), as well as master's graduates and post doctoral scholars, were exceeded. Out the outcome level, expected impacts on awareness of the limits of NbS were achieved, as were impacts on capacity within the Southern African region to implement more equitable NbS. One outcome that was included in the project's proposal as a 'low confidence' outcome (meaning the project was unsure

if they would achieve it), related to "improved decision making, policy development and planning and implementation processes related to NbS at local and national level that incorporate increased engagements with local women, other vulnerable groups and community beneficiaries". While some aspects of this outcome have been achieved, such as the incorporation of insights into equitable NbS into various policy processes (see Project Highlights), at the time of closure the project did not yet have evidence of local women and other vulnerable groups being better integrated into NbS implementation because of this project. This is, however, a long term outcome, and it is not surprising that evidence of this impact is not yet available.

## 6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC’s strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.

Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

The project was conceived under the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan but has also contributed to Strategy 2030.

In terms of the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan, the project has contributed toward:

- Large-scale positive change: By taking aim at questions of equity in relation to transboundary sustainability challenges across 11 countries in Southern Africa, this project held the possibility of large scale impact from inception. The research has developed indices that can support equitable decisions about NbS initiatives. These innovations have been incorporated into regional and international policy and funding processes, setting the stage of large scale impact going forward.

- Build the leaders of today and tomorrow: The lead PI of this project was an early career researcher (Dr. Holden), and she was mentored and supported by a highly respected and successful female researcher (Prof. Shackleton). For her work on NbS through this project, Dr Holden received two highly competitive awards recognising her contributions to the field: the AXA XL Climate Water Nexus Award and the Frontiers Planet Prize. She was also successful on two international grant applications. Also as an outcome of this project, Dr Holden has created a new research lab at the University of Cape Town purely focused on equitable and sustainable NbS for climate change adaptation and mitigation in Africa: the People in Nature &amp; Climate Lab (PiNC Lab). Dr Holden is well positioned now to become a leader in this field for years to come. The many masters students and post doctoral fellows mentored through this project also offer signifiant promise of widner long term leadership in the field of NbS in the years to come.

In terms of Strategy 2030, the project took explicit aim at the intersection of the two cross cutting themes in our strategy: climate change and rising inequalities. As such, this project has significantly developed our understanding of these intersections, challenging preconceived notions of equity and climate 'solutions' from an explicitly Southern perspective. The project has also produced high quality research in the form of peer reviewed papers and cutting edge climate modelling, while also investing significant time in knowledge sharing through its several innovative communications strategies and outputs.

## FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

The project performed well financially. As a low risk institution, there was no financial reporting until the end of the project. This created some difficulty for the PO, as the project lead was concerned about exchange rate losses from the outset, yet there was no real way of IDRC assisting them to understand the real risks in this regard since we did not receive financial reports. In the end, an interim financial report was requested as part of a no cost extension request, and this was the first time IDRC had sight of the financial situation. While the Centre's

IDRC·CRDI

approach to low risk institutions (in terms of not requiring financial reporting) makes sense from a GAD efficiency perspective, it does create challenges for the PO who is tasked with advising the grantee on how to use remaining funds and how to deal with exchange rate fluctuations. Currently, PO's struggle to provide solid and useful advice to grantees in terms of financial management for those grantees in low risk institutions.

# STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

The biggest risk faced at the outset of this project related to the continued Covid 19 restrictions that were in place when it began. There was a concern that these restrictions may make student fieldwork impossible and undermine relationship building efforts in the region. This risk was mitigated by the integration of flexibility within the work packages and the identification of contingency plans, regular reflections and an emphasis on online meetings and workshops. An important face-to-face regional policy meeting had to pivot to an online engagement, and indeed in-person engagement with policy makers in the region was undermined. However, the planning toward, and ability to shift toward, on-line engagements for the regional engagements worked well and impacts on the outcomes were minimal. Student field work was delayed but was able to proceed.

An unexpected risk was exchange rate fluctuations between the CAD and the ZAR, made worse during the COVID recovery, which occurred during this project. Although the project did experience exchange rate losses, savings from in-person regional meetings could be shifted to budget lines where losses were most acutely felt. IDRC's flexibility in this regard continues to be a strength that supports grantees to react to unexpected fluctuations in exchange rates.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

Ethics approval was obtained through the University of Cape Town Faculty of Science Research Ethics Committee. No significant challenges or new learning emerged during implementation.

# Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

# Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

I am pleased to have read this PCR and been made more aware of the project's approach and outcomes, including the next steps noted below that provide for some continuity of effort by the ACDI team. From the outset I was interested in the model adopted for mentoring a more junior PI by a more experienced co-PI, which is becoming gradually more common but it's worth

noting the value of promoting this approach to developing the responsibility, motivation and skills of earlier career researchers.

I'm attracted to doing more reading about the more concrete examples that this project has shed light on with respect to the challenges and opportunities for ensuring equitable outcomes in the development and adoption of nature-based solutions. This would be worth sharing more widely beyond our teams programming in Africa.

I also note the point about the challenge of financial monitoring of projects with low-risk institutions that do not require regular financial reporting yet may need more assistance than expected when they find challenges with exchange loss or inflation. We should be mindful that the opportunity remains to seek additional financial information/reporting if the project coordinators identify the need for assistance.

Thanks to Georgina for the guidance to the development and implementation of this valuable project and continuing to ensure the lessons get shared.

## Action Items / Next Steps

Dr Holden has secured funding through the CLARE program (IDRC-FCDO) to offer training and capacity building across the African continent on the intersections among equity and NbS, specifically in urban settings. This new funding offers the possibility to scale the lessons from this project through capacity building efforts. The responsible PO will collaborate with their CLARE colleagues to track progress and support further impact.
