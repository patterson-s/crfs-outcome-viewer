# Project Abstract

Heartwater is an economically important disease of cattle, sheep and goats, with estimated losses of approximately US$48 million annually in Southern Africa. The current Heartwater vaccine available is the live blood-based vaccine that is produced and marketed by Onderstepoort Biological Products (OBP) of South Africa. This vaccine is not farmer friendly, needing intravenous administration by veterinary health professionals, post-vaccination treatment with tetracycline, and does not protect against most isolates circulating in the field. It also carries the risk of spreading other blood-borne diseases and requires ultra-cold storage (-196°C). These storage requirements make it an expensive vaccine for smallholder farmers.

In this project, OBP was to optimize the processes of producing and scaling up a new live attenuated tissue culture derived Heartwater vaccine developed by the Agriculture Research Council Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute. The project also seeked to stabilize the vaccine by lyophilisation to remove dependence on cold chain for storage and transportation. Unlike the current vaccine, this new vaccine has been shown to be safe, fully protective in goats and sheep (young, old and pregnant ewes), as well as in Holstein Friesian cattle and can be administered through intramuscular route of administration. It is easier to produce and has a broader cross protection.

It was expected that by the end of the project, the production process of the new Heartwater vaccine would have been optimized, the vaccine registered in South Africa, and the production technology transferred to the African Union - Centre for Ticks and Tick-Borne Diseases in Malawi.

This project was funded through the Livestock Vaccine Innovation Fund, a partnership between the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Global Affairs Canada and Canada's International Development Research Centre.

# PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

1. Optimization of the Heartwater production process was completed at OBP. This saw a complete transition from blood-based vaccines to cell culture produced vaccines that will not have all the setback of the blood vaccine e.g. risk of disease transmission, need for very cold storage, use of animal in production.
2. Production of a large-scale pilot batch of the vaccine. Three such batches were produced at OBP as part of the requirement for proving that it can be produced with consistent parameters. This will later be needed for registration of the vaccine. The said batches passed OBP's quality control tests.
3. Technology transfer between OVI and OBP. Initial technology transfer was between Onderstepoort Biological Products (OBP) and Agricultural Research Council-Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute (ARC-OVI) for the technology. At the time of project completion, the transfer to CTTBD in Malawi had not been fully executed. This became a point of legal arbitration between IDRC and the two grantees which at the time of writing this report was still ongoing.

# RESEARCH OUTPUTS

2. List up to 10 most important research outputs generated by the project. Where possible, provide the link.

Outputs are the directly achievable products of a project's completed activities (e.g. policy briefs, journal articles, research papers, trained people, etc.). Indicate the project outputs that were published on an open access basis. What, if any, outputs resulting from this project will be published open access beyond the duration of the project, and it is possible that the grantee will seek further IDRC support for this?

No publications.

3. If appropriate, explain why outputs were not completed or were of poor quality.

Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

There were no publications from this project probably because the final Heartwater vaccine formulation was not protective.

# PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

Last Revised March 2021

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC·CRDI

The research was important to fund because as outlined in the abstract, Heartwater affects a lot of ruminant livestock species and directly food security in Africa. Without a proper vaccine it is difficult to control the disease. This project was to make available a vaccine that is cost effective to manufacturers, easier to use and safer for animals.

5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

The research was successful for two of the project objectives.

- To develop and optimise an alternative method of Heartwater vaccine production.
- To improve the stability of the current attenuated Heartwater vaccine by lyophilisation.

However, the final animal trials could not demonstrate vaccine protection. Further, complete transfer of the technology became an arduous issue including a protracted delay at executing the triparty technology agreement between OBP and the Centre for Ticks and Tick-born Diseases ("CTTBD"). IDRC had to institute a legal process with an external counsel to try and force the grantees to complete the technology transfer. An arbitration notice was served on the two grantees in January 2023 (Annex 4) and at the time of writing this PCR, the process was still ongoing with the grantees claiming that transfer could not be completed due to failure of the candidate vaccine's efficacy. Annex 5 of this report shows the points of contention as elaborated by IDRC legal counsel.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.

Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

Heartwater is an infectious tick-borne disease that affects cattle, sheep, goats as well as wild ruminants, particularly the springbok. The disease is caused by the rickettsial Ehrlichia ruminantium and has been reported in most African countries. It is an economically important livestock disease in South Africa with mortality rates as high as 90% in susceptible animals. Current measures used to control the disease include vaccination with the commercially available live virulent heartwater infective blood, which confers protection in varying degrees of immunity and does not meet most requirements of an ideal vaccine (safety, efficacy, ease of use, affordability, long-lasting immunity). The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics is another method used by farmers to control heartwater disease and more farmers are inclined to this strategy as the current vaccine does not confer protection to many circulating strains of E. ruminantium in the field. The main methods of disease prevention rely on restricting cattle movements, tick control, or immunization. The first two methods are difficult to enforce. The immunization method involves inoculation of cattle with a live vaccine and concurrent long-acting oxytetracycline treatment to minimize clinical signs. Although the vaccine is efficacious, its production is cumbersome and expensive. Additional technical challenges include dose standardization,

the requirement for many cattle to determine the dose, and risks associated with tick protein contamination. The requirement for concurrent treatment using long-acting oxytetracycline makes the method even more expensive, consequently reducing adoption.

The main objective of the project was development and optimization of production process of the live attenuated heartwater vaccine at commercial scale and data generation required for dossier registration/submission and commercialization. As such, the contribution to IDRC strategic objectives in the areas of knowledge generation.

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

The technology transfer became a protracted matter. The grantees repeatedly reported this as not completed despite many reminders through reactions to technical reporting and various project update meetings. The project closed without this objective being fully met. As a results IDRC resorted to an arbitration process to enforce the obligation.

This decision not only showcases IDRC's responsible use of taxpayers' funds but also serves as a valuable lesson and deterrent for other grantees who may consider evading their grant agreement responsibilities.

# STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

- The COVID lockdown introduced major delays to project progress as lab were closed for extended times during complete lockdowns in South Africa. This was mitigated by granting a 12-month no-cost extension to February 2022.
- Noncompliance of transfer of technology to third party (CTTBD) was not envisaged in the PAD. However, IDRC took the decision to pursue this through a legal redress as a mitigation.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

All ethical clearances were obtained. However, these took a long time to come through as South Africa was undergoing changes in the regulation involving the amendment of Medicines and Related Substances Act 101 of 1965. This delayed the approval of Section 20 of the Animal Diseases Act (Act 35 of 1984) of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and Section 21 on the use of unregistered products (Act 101 of 1965), of the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority. Such approvals were originally

granted by one department.

## Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

This project was funded by LVIF with a focus on working with manufacturers to advance the availability of livestock vaccine in LMICs. This project in addition to the other funded in this similar stream were funded through a targeted call directed at various manufacturers. The project was ambitiously pursuing various difficult objectives: optimizing the processes of producing and scaling up a new live attenuated tissue culture derived Heartwater vaccine, reaching stabilisation of the vaccine by lyophilisation to remove dependence on cold chain for storage and transportation and registration of the vaccine in South Africa, and the production technology transferred to the African Union - Centre for Ticks and Tick-Borne Diseases in Malawi. At the end of this first project, only 1 in 4 of the specific objectives were met. This project is the first one in the animal health portfolio where a clear non-compliance of transfer of technology to a third party; this risk had not been envisaged in the PAD. However, IDRC took the decision to pursue this through a legal redress as a mitigation, which is also a first for the Animal Health team. It has been very heavy on the Senior Program Specialist and the legal counsel at IDRC. As this PCR is being completed the mitigation is not yet finalized.

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

As presented by the PO in this PCR, this project was not fully successful in meeting all of its objectives. The final animal trials could not demonstrate vaccine protection, a key risk that needed special management attention. The technology transfer to the Centre for Ticks and Tick-Borne Diseases in Malawi was not fully executed. It became a point of legal arbitration between IDRC and the two grantees.

Research is a process; sometimes, the results may not be as expected. This is a reality of investments in upstream research, such as the Livestock Vaccine Innovation Fund (LVIF). Sometimes, projects need to be stopped or not extended if they do not provide the results in the direction expected by the program. This project, for example, was ambitiously pursuing various challenging objectives, but still, only 1 in 4 of the specific objectives were met.

IDRC managed the situation of non-compliance with the transfer of technology to a third party by pursuing it through legal redress as mitigation. This decision showcases IDRC's responsible use of taxpayers' funds and serves as a valuable lesson and deterrent for other grantees who may consider evading their grant agreement responsibilities

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

June 25, 2020

Dear Dr. Misheck Mulumba and Dr. Baty Dungu

I write to you in my role as the IDRC Program Leader with responsibility for the implementation of the Livestock Vaccine Innovation Fund (LVIF). I am also the manager for Victor Mbao, the IDRC program officer with whom your project teams regularly communicate.

You are both the heads of the two project partners on the project "Development of an attenuated live Heartwater vaccine for use in domestic ruminants". Your project is now two years into implementation. It was recently granted an 11 months extension due to cell contamination related delays and vaccine comparison trials.

After speaking with Victor, I am concerned with the significant underachievement in meeting planned milestones to date. We appreciate that the CoVid-19 pandemic has created new challenges for all of us. However, after reviewing your most recent technical and financial reports, our financial records show that as of March 31, 2020, the OVI component was 83% (CA$573,781) behind in expenditures. That of OBP was 46% (CA$156,616) behind.

The main technical areas of concern are:

1. The technology transfer to CTTBD. This has been sidelined for some time now. According to the agreements between IDRC and your institutions, the technology transfer agreement was to be signed within the first 7 months of the project. There was good progress following a physical due diligence of CTTBD by OBP that confirmed transfer was feasible and an MTA was even signed between your institutions and CTTBD. However, the latest technical report surprisingly introduces a new twist in that OBP is first to obtain an MTA from OVI before the transfer can take place. This introduces considerable risk for achieving this milestone and needs immediate redress.

2. Registration – Progress towards obtaining Section 20 and 21 approvals has been delayed by at least 6 months. This is a significant risk on achieving the milestone of vaccine registration before end of project.

3. Comparison of new and current Heartwater vaccines. The 24 months technical report does not give any information on when these experiments will be conducted or any preparations towards this important milestone, despite the fact that this was one of the key reasons for the extension that was granted.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC·CRDI

As you know, given current program timelines, there is little chance of further extension for any projects funded by the LVIF. Any budgeted funds that are unused in this project will not be available to your organization for other uses and will have to be returned to the Centre.

Next week, we will contact you to set up a call for the week of July 6th to 10th. I want to hear about your strategy to develop and rapidly begin implementing a plan that effectively reverses the delays and ultimately gets the project back on a track to meet planned milestones. As always, Victor is available to work with you to develop the plan to use available financial resources for your project and ensure that you achieve key objectives and milestones as specified in your respective grant agreements.

Please know that your project is an important one in the LVIF portfolio, and we are anxious that it concludes in a successful manner.

I very much look forward to our conversation.

Dear Dr. Moephuli and Dr. Mabombo,

RE: Transfer of Heartwater Vaccine Pursuant to Project Grant No. 108631-001/002

I write to you today in response to your submission of the final technical report for project 108631: Development of an attenuated live Heartwater vaccine for use in domestic ruminants.

Despite the successes achieved, Project Objective 1.3 under the respective Grant Agreements ("To transfer the production technology to the African Union -Centre for Ticks and Tick Borne Diseases") remains unmet as noted by you in the report. We specifically note that the execution of the tripartite technology agreement and second phase training was not completed despite numerous assurances as well as broad commitments to the transfer of the technology in its entirety, from both ARC-OVI and OBP. By way of example, such assurances were included in formal written correspondence in July 2020, November 2020, March 2021, and most recently on December 13th, 2021. It is our understanding that there are no existing barriers to carrying out the transfer, nor were any explanations provided as to why this objective was not met. As such, both ARC-OVI and OBP are currently in default of their obligations under their respective Grant Agreements.

The technology transfer is a critical component of these Projects to ensure widespread access to the attenuated vaccine and was essential to IDRC's initial decision to fund the Projects. Given the

particular nature of this objective, it is not possible for IDRC to find an alternative means to achieving the same result. As a Crown corporation created by the Parliament of Canada, and a steward of public and donor funds, IDRC must ensure accountability for the use of the LVIF program funds. Failure to meet this objective not only compromises the important and valuable work itself but the reputation of IDRC and its ability to hold the confidence of the Canadian public and its Program Partners. Taking all the foregoing into account, we require a resolution to this issue.

This letter shall serve as notice of this dispute pursuant to section A26 of your respective Grant Agreements. Should we be unable to resolve this issue within 60 days of the date above, IDRC will consider submitting the matter for arbitration to be held pursuant to the UNICTRAL rules in Ottawa, as also agreed to in section A26 of the Grant Agreement.

Please note that as both ARC-OVI and OBP are currently in default of their respective Grant Agreements and while the sixty-day resolution period is active, IDRC will temporarily withhold the final settling of accounts, approval of the technical report and as such making any further payments or requesting repayment as applicable.

Finally, noting that the technology transfer was to be completed by February of 2022, and reserving all rights and remedies available to IDRC whether pursuant to the Grant Agreements or otherwise at law, our office will be in touch shortly to organize a meeting to negotiate an amicable solution. We would also welcome any response from your offices in the interim.

Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to discuss with us.
