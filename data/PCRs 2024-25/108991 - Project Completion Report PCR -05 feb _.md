## Project Abstract

The Paris Agreement on Climate Change established the global goal on adaptation (GGA) of enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience, and reducing vulnerability to climate change. Furthermore, it called for periodic assessment of the overall progress made in achieving the global goal on adaptation through the Global Stock Take (GST) on Adaptation. The need for climate adaptation is widely accepted in both the science and policy spheres. One of the key messages from the Intergovernmental Panel on climate Change (IPCC) report is that 'limiting global warming to 1.5 C to give people and ecosystems more room to adapt and remain below relevant risk thresholds. This project builds on the need to identify methods and tools for monitoring progress on adaptation in the agricultural sector as it has been expressed under decision 4/CP.23 Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture of the COP 19. The project was implemented through two streams (a) "Research" stream (b) "Policy-science platform and capacity building" stream. Whereas the "policy-science platform and capacity building" stream was coordinated by the Africa Group of Negotiators Expert Support team, the research stream was coordinated and led by The World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) and the African Centre for Technologies Studies ACTS administrates the grant and responsible to institutionalize AGNES. The project produced tools, information, and publications (policy briefs and technical reports) that enhance understanding and assessment of collective adaptation progress.

## PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

The Measuring Adaptation Progress in the Agriculture Sector (MAP Ag) project was built to fill a demand identified under the Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture KJWA topic 2(b) at COP 19 referring as "methods and approaches for assessing Adaptation on co-benefits and resilience" which acknowledges that the current state of knowledge is not sufficient

for reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of adaptation efforts". The KJWA is the first substantive outcome and UNFCCC COP decision in the history of the agenda item on agriculture which has been under negotiation since 2011.

Below are some of its outstanding results:

MAP AG project contributed to the development of the Global Goal on Adaptation framework GGA, defined targets and indicators, and published results of the adaptation actions for measuring and tracking National Adaptation Plans NAPs and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) performances across African countries. This enabled to reach a conceptual agreement on the three elements of the Global Goal on Adaptation GGA: enhanced capacity, reduced vulnerability, and increased resilience.

It has enhanced global climate resilience through the establishment of clear adaptation goals, improved measurement and tracking of adaptation efforts and increased awareness and consensus on adaptation priorities. This tool for measurement and tracking of adaptation at the national level is key for assessing adaptation progress towards achieving the Paris Agreement goals through its application in the Global Stocktake exercise.

MAP AG has been instrumental in the implementation of the Glasgow-Sharm el-Sheikh GlaSS work programme on the global goal on adaptation in agriculture. Results of its policy brief number 12 has been incorporated in the text of the GlaSS resolution.

The project developed and tested the capacity development and training programme to ensure coherence through the AGNES Climate Governance, Diplomacy and Negotiations Leadership Program and trainings were delivered through Cohort IX (July 2022) and Cohort X (November 2022) and involved 67 and 60 people, respectively, about 60% were women. These courses improved decision-support mechanisms by providing policymakers and other key stakeholders with relevant information on the strengths, weaknesses, and performance of their NAPs and NDCs.

AGNES in collaboration with the Accelerating Impacts of CGIAR Climate Research for Africa (AICCRA) organised a key Pre-Cop 27 workshop which helped the African Group of Negotiators AGNs to prepare a common position for the Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture (KJWA). This workshop delivered a common African position on the future of Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture and a draft text for negotiation at 57th session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) of the UNFCCC. To this end, four technical experts were supported to attend the COP 27 and advised AGN negotiators on matters of GGA and agriculture.

1. If appropriate, explain why outputs were not completed or were of poor quality. Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

The MAP-Ag project has achieved some of the expected results such as the preparation of the Global Goal on Adaptation Framework, which helped to build an African common position for the Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture (KJWA). This project was fully aligned with the AGNES advisory role of assisting the AGN, its outputs were represented exclusively by "grey" literature. The project envisaged that Dr. Peter Minang from ICRAF would lead the "research" stream, but this task did not happen in practice. As in project # 108963, Dr. Geroge Wamukoya has performed almost all duties.

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

2. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

MAP AG provided a new starting point and impetus for developing and testing tools for measuring adaptation progress at different scales. The Program Officer has recently perceived a growing number of new peer-reviewed articles addressing the climate adaptation measurements in African countries but authored by non- African researchers.

This project contributed significantly to improve the understanding of the global goal on adaptation and the ability to assess adaptation progress by providing knowledge and information on the effectiveness of adaptation actions in the agricultural sector in Africa. It contributed significantly with the effective assessment of NAPs and NDCs in the frame of the Global Stocktake exercise.

3. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

This project has not achieved any unintended outcome.

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

6. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

The African Center for Technology Studies ACTS showed weaknesses in its ability to comply with IDRC standard financial and technical reporting. This has meant countless requests for clarification and additional transactional costs for IDRC. GAD staff confronted difficult situations, such as currently where ACTS and AGNES are still having disputes over the management of funds with mutual accusations of responsibilities for such trusts. In late January 2024, GAD called on both parties to reach an agreement. Currently, ACTS is ranked as a medium level risk organization with permission to administer up to $12 million CAD. I recommend conducting an institutional financial and administrative assessment of ACTS before proceeding with any further granting.

# STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

7. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

The mitigation risk strategy included that the project should be managed through a project management committee comprising representatives of ACTS, AGNES, ICRAF and six delegates from the core partners i.e. Universities. This has been recurrently requested by IDRC in the last two years, but it was never put in place by grantees. ACTS failed to institutionalize AGNES, which has been a long-awaited goal to consolidate AGNES. Finally, an independent final evaluation should have been conducted in the last two months before the end of the project, but it has not happened yet.

8. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

This project was created to fill a demand identified under the Koronovia Joint Work on Agriculture at COP19. Given the acknowledgement that the current state of knowledge is not sufficient for reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of adaptation efforts, this project's aim was to strengthen the methods and approaches for assessing Adaptation on co-benefits and resilience in the agriculture sector. The project was part of IDRC's efforts to assist African climate negotiators in the lead up to and at Conference of the Parties (COPs) and in relation to the commitments made under the Paris Agreement. The initial intent was to have the PO check-in with the partners at COP events. However, given the restrictions on travel of IDRC staff due to the COVID pandemic and other constraints, the PO never did attend any COPs in person during the three-year project. The PO, based in Uruguay, never did meet the grantees in person.

The project had several successes. It influenced global adaptation policy in agriculture with a policy brief being incorporated into the Glasgow-Sharm el-Sheikh Resolution; In the lead up to COP 27, the project assisted the African Group of Negotiators to deliver a common African position on the future of the Koronovia Joint Work on Agriculture and a draft text at the 57th session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice of the UNFCCC.

It also strengthened climate leadership skills and improved knowledge and negotiation capacities of 127 African climate leaders (60% of whom were women).

However, this project has also had some significant challenges both at the program and administrative levels, leading to the project only barely meeting its third and fourth objectives. However, ACTS failed to institutionalize AGNES, which had been a long-awaited goal. Key reports were left unfinished, including the policy paper on Global Goal on Adaptation, which is still missing an executive summary. Finally, an independent final evaluation should have been conducted in the last two months of the project but this has not happened yet.

## Action Items / Next Steps

Click here to enter text.

As suggested by the Program Officer, I recommend that SIE and GAD work together to come up with viable solutions to the current impasse and to ensure that all project outputs are submitted to IDRC (such as an independent final evaluation, the report from the Climate Governance, Diplomacy and Negotiations Leadership Program, etc). Further, I would recommend that GAD conducts an institutional assessment of ACTS, given that this organisation is a recipient of substantial IDRC funding from SIE and other divisions. A discussion with the Regional Director for ESARO on how to manage the ACTS relationship going forward would also be very useful.
