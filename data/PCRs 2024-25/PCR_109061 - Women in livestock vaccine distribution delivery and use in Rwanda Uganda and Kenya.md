# Project Abstract

In Rwanda, Kenya and Uganda, it is estimated that between 75% and 90% of smallholder livestock farmers are women. These farmers face production challenges due to animal diseases, including Peste des Petits Ruminants, Rift Valley Fever, and Newcastle disease. Many animal-associated diseases are preventable, but women farmers are often not able to fully benefit from livestock vaccines. Barriers include unsuitable vaccines in the local market, lack of extension services, and unreliable structures for vaccine delivery. To empower women to effectively contribute and benefit from the vaccine supply chain as entrepreneurs, service/product providers and users, more attention is needed on the gender related technical, social, cultural, and economic barriers that they encounter and the opportunities therein. The objectives of this project are to: 1) generate evidence and formulate strategies that help position women to effectively and efficiently contribute to and benefit from livestock vaccines; 2) enhance women's participation in livestock vaccine distribution, delivery and use; 3) test gender focused models that target specific entry points for women along the vaccine value chain; and 4) provide data and information that impact programmatic and policy interventions. The project will use a comprehensive strategy that integrates gender analysis tools and frameworks for action research in the vaccine value chain analysis. The research team will use three main tools: the USAID five domains of gender analysis, the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index, and the seven steps of action research in value chains from the Danish Institute for International Studies. Other innovative qualitative methodologies will be used to reach women, including focus meals, chalk talks, jar voices, and Vaxxer calendars. The results generated will identify opportunities that can be used to empower women smallholder farmers and entrepreneurs to contribute to and benefit from livestock vaccines thereby improving livestock production and women's livelihoods.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

1. Generated data and evidence on women's role in the livestock vaccine value chain (LVVC) to inform programme and policy interventions, as well as mapped the LVVC stakeholders and their drivers, incentives, and gender capacities. This is the first time the LVVC was mapped with a gender analysis in Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda.

2. Increased access to and adoption of vaccines by livestock smallholders, especially women, in targeted countries, through training and equipping 30 Animal Health Service Providers (AHSP), including installing 34 solar fridges, to serve 140,000 households in Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda. This has resulted in a 72% increase in access to animal health service providers in the target regions. Rates of farmers vaccinating chickens against Newcastle disease have increased from 30% at baseline to 80%, and at endline 53% of farmers vaccinated their goats. These gains are likely to be sustained on the long-term, as the AHSPs are reporting an increase in demand for their services and the resulting income is sufficient to keep them in business. Furthermore, community vaccinators in Rwanda have been absorbed by a new project (PREVENT) to provide vaccinations, and Uganda and Kenya, they have been embedded into the local veterinary system and are working with county veterinary officers &amp; county development officers.

3. Shifted power dynamics and attitudes in the household and in animal production in favour of women. Evidenced through many participatory approaches, the project reports a significant increase in the decision-making power of women smallholder livestock farmers on production and income-related matters. Men and women project stakeholders report shifts in mindsets whereby women's roles and contributions within the household have become more visible and appreciated by men in the household, and changes in women's time use and men taking on some new household tasks.

4. Increased gender awareness of government and private sector with early evidence of responsive policies, public services, regulations, and strategies in the delivery of vaccines. The project has consistently engaged key decision-makers and conducted trainings and gender transformative workshops, creating new government and private sector allied for women in the LVVC. In Rwanda, district planners for the ministry of finance &amp; planning have started integrating gender into their planning. In Uganda, they are considering adopting the project methodology for other large animal health programs. The government extension current uses a 'parish model' (that keeps different types of extension separate) and are looking to adopt the projects' 'hub model', which brings all extension together and includes women groups and community leaders. In Kenya the veterinary services are now considering procuring smaller doses for communities.

5. Increased numbers of women in the higher nodes of the vaccine value chain and sustainable economic benefits for women AHSPs. Created a women centered entrepreneurial private sector delivery model; created a team of Animal Health Service Providers (AHSPs) who can run successful businesses, own agrovet stores, treat animals, have a source of income, and be positioned higher up in the LVVC as drug shop owners and deliverers, with the hope that eventually they can accumulate credit and even move further up to distribution and manufacturing. The project trained 750 women on group formation and networking, supporting their capacity to self-organize, advocate for their needs, and participate in decision making in the LVVC and access networking opportunities with private sector distributors, pharmacists and industry.

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

The project contributed many scientific articles on barriers and opportunities for women in the Livestock Vaccines Value Chain (LVVC), and mapped out and engaged critical stakeholders. They have tested scalable models for empowering women to contribute and benefit from the LVVC. The project has tested a variety of innovative participatory tools to both engage critical partners and ensure the voices of the projects' beneficiaries directly reached decision makers.

This research was important to fund, as it filled a critical knowledge and evidence gap on how to address the widespread barriers and limitations impeding women from participating and/or fully benefiting from the livestock vaccine chain.

The key scientific findings were that:

- Women play a very significant but invisible role in livestock production across all 3 countries. Significantly more women than men participate in daily animal chores, while men participate in irregular activities linked to control &amp; distribution of production, thus reaping most of the benefit.
- The primary issues preventing women livestock smallholders from using livestock vaccines in the study area include lack of vaccine access due to cold storage, and lack of knowledge. Other barriers include lack of extension services, social and

cultural limitations within societies, non-gender responsive legal systems and structures, and unreliable structures for vaccine delivery;

- Assumptions made about rural women need to be tested: there is a widespread belief that rural women cannot pay for livestock vaccines and would prefer them to be given for free. The project team found that most women were willing and able to pay for livestock vaccines as long as access was secured and animal health service could be accessed as well.
- Mapping the VVC stakeholders: Who they are and how they impact women empowerment and gender equality, their gender capacities (skills, knowledge, perceptions, attitudes, behavior) of the actors, their incentives and drivers, and identified opportunities engagement with women smallholders through networks; Creating allies for women was found to be key for laying the groundwork for sustainable change.
- Aligning technical interventions with gender transformative interventions fosters long-term outcomes supporting gender equality. Building in gender training of technical stakeholders – including the research team itself – is key. By challenging the context of gender inequity and enhancing resource access and control for women, structural barriers can be dismantled and constraining norms can shift within the lifetime of a project; significant impact can be seen in a relatively short period.
- The importance of linking siloed government services: The project brought together district veterinary officers with community development officers and county officers for gender and youth to find solutions for the very high prevalence of livestock diseases in household production, tackling economic hardship and gender inequality concurrently. By engaging the right critical partners, especially the regulatory agencies and private sector vaccine distributors and deliverers, entities (public and private) that deliver services at scale to the population on a regular basis, the model has been working successfully.

# 5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

This project comprised a strong team of researchers led by a very driven PI who is committed to, and believe in, feminist approaches, women's empowerment and inclusion in every part of the research process. The structure of the LVIF call, requiring gender leads as the PIs was essential to its success. The length of this PCR section will testify to the fact that projects with a gender-transformative ambition using mixed-methods and participatory approaches, especially across multiple project sites, are complex and benefit considerably from a strong relationship with the IDRC responsible officer and from participating in a cohort in order to adapt to situational challenges and achieve results.

The results of the project are in line with what was anticipated, despite setbacks associated with conducting fieldwork during the COVID-19 pandemic. Where the project evolved differently, decisions were made at the beginning of the project, such as shifting the site from Karamoja (as another LVIF project 109062 was planning to work there) to Sembabule in Uganda, and not being able to work with Community Health Workers in Rwanda to test co-location of human and animal health as was proposed in their proposal but denied by the government of Rwanda.

In late 2019, it was one of two projects in the women's empowerment cohort that was considered and received supplementary funding to scale results. A new objective was added, and the team committed to reaching double the number of smallholders and test two models: one focused on improving vaccine availability in Uganda and Kenya through addressing the cold chain and training AHSPs; the other focused in Rwanda on increasing knowledge and awareness of animal health and vaccination. The extra work did stretch the team as it increased the coordination and communication needs. While the project is confident in the impact of its model, the analysis of the scaling component was weak, as they ran out of time in the wrap-up phase. The project is seeking additional funding to

conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the model, which could yield interesting insights on the potential for further scale-up.

Why did it work/happen this way?

- This is a strong team (global and country) that is committed to, and believes in, feminist approaches, participatory approaches and women's empowerment, and values the contributions of a multidisciplinary team. The structure of the LVIF call, requiring gender leads as PIs was instrumental to the project's success.
- The integration of social science approaches in the very technical field of animal health was highly impactful.
- Working through the establishment (district and sub-county offices) in actual delivery of training and regular engagement and training with them to get messages across.
- Provision of seed capital in terms of solar fridges and starter pack vaccines beyond trainings was important to break the key barriers and achieve faster results for women owned businesses.
- Through engagement of critical partners and breaking of silos enhanced collaboration between public and private vets who previously viewed themselves as competitors; collaboration between vets and CDOs (social scientists) for joint problem-solving.
- The continuous support and peer-learning from the LVIF cohort of projects, including annual learning meetings and community of practice, joint dissemination and engagement efforts, and IDRC support and needs-based trainings.

Unintended outcomes:

- COVID-19 greatly impacted (halted) all field related activities in all countries. The team was nearly a year behind in implementation of activities. To mitigate, they reverted to virtual meetings including sessions of workshops for the preparation of manuscripts and telephone surveys with participants. IDRC granted all 4 projects in the cohort, including this one, an extension enabling them to complete activities as planned. This team also supported the COVID-19 response efforts (providing masks, soap, PPE) to mitigate impact in the communities where they are engaged.
- The project was extended a second time, bringing the end date to the end of July 2023. This extension, granted to all the projects in the cohort provided additional time for knowledge sharing activities and to implement recommendations related to project and impact sustainability. From IDRC's perspective, it also eased the logistical burden of attending Women Deliver, which took place in Kigali July 2023 and was the venue for the final dissemination and workshop, enabling the full cohort to gather in person for the first time since the inception workshop.
- The Women's Empowerment in Livestock Index (WELI) was one common tool that was to be used and compared across the cohort of LVIF projects for a meta-analysis for stronger data and greater impact of findings on women's empowerment. However, the WELI tool a pilot tool which required much more resources then anticipated. The team found that the baseline WELI results did not match their qualitative findings on empowerment and found them therefore of little use, and after much deliberation, they opted not to use the WELI for their endlines. (see related publication in list of outputs above)
- The project team also highlighted some unexpected positive spillover effects of their work, which can be read in full in the final report. Some highlights were that trained community members used the informational tools and materials provided to them in novel ways, taking on the role of training other community members on livestock and gender, connecting to animal health service providers, and accessing better markets for their livestock. The solar fridges provided by the projects being the only reliable cold storage point in many rural communities are used by government officials to store vaccines for other diseases.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC’s strategic objectives?
Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.
Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

The project contributes to IDRC outcomes on gender equality by facilitating women’s empowerment through training and access to resources and focuses on the prevention of emerging infectious diseases and zoonotic disease, leading to improved livestock health and productivity. It also enhances women’s economic empowerment and leadership. The project is also well aligned with the CRFS (and IDRC’s) gender strategy on promoting gender-transformative approaches with a high potential to change existing gender norms towards gender equality. The contributions towards this outcome were highlighted through the final dissemination activities that took place at Women Deliver 2023 in Kigali, an important global forum for advancing gender equality.

Impact at scale: The project took place in Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. The final reach will be determined at project end, but at the time of writing this PCR The project has reached 500,000 people with expanded animal health services and vaccine access. Beyond the direct beneficiaries, it is expected to reach many more given the interventions are working with several government departments and extension services (agricultural/livestock, social services and gender, nutrition, trade and cooperatives), vaccine distributors and agri-dealers.

Building leaders for today and tomorrow: The project places a significant emphasis on the inclusion of early career researchers with nine master’s students well embedded in the research (three in each country). This helped them fulfil their academic requirements for summer/field practicum. The project also built community leaders by training women and men as community vaccinators and peer educators, and women cooperatives in leadership and entrepreneurship.

Partner of Choice: The project was funded through LVIF, a donor-partnership program comprising IDRC, Global Affairs Canada, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The Tufts University Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine (TUCSVM) has collaborated with the African One Health University Network (AFROHUN), a network of 20+ countries in Africa for the last 9 years through USAID’s Emerging Pandemics Threat (EPT) program. This project leveraged this network and research partnership in Rwanda, Kenya and Uganda. The project also built on a collaboration between Tufts University and the University of Florida (running until June 2022) in implementing innovative methods to enhance the delivery of a thermostable PPR vaccine in the pastoral communities in Uganda and Kenya, a natural link between this project and another LVIF gender project (#109062).

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

Personnel costs were initially at 46% of the total budget, and reduced to 33% after the responsible officer with the team to reduce the budget. The personnel costs are still higher than the 25% recommended by IDRC, however justifiable given the scope of work and activities taking place in three countries over the duration and need to ensure quality results. Women's empowerment in the livestock value chain is a relatively new area of development research, with few institutions experienced in this niche. The Tufts and AFROHUN team represent a high calibre set of researchers who have extensive field and project management experience on gender integration as well as vaccine development and delivery and have been invested in this work together for the last nine years. IDRC should review its cap on personnel costs for this type of social science research if we expect high quality results from high calibre teams.

The flexibility in IDRC granting allowed them extensions that were critical as the team lost nearly a full year as a result of the pandemic. The second extension enabled them to take advantage of the major Women Deliver Conference in Kigali in July 2023 to disseminate their findings at a side event, alongside the other projects in the cohort, and through the launch of their documentary film at the Arts &amp; Film Festival.

The focus on deliverables by the Responsible Officer and not so much sticking to defined process details was helpful for an action research type of work.

Regular bi-monthly check-in meetings with IDRC were critical to give immediate feedback rather than waiting at the end of the reporting period.

The cohort model

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC·CRDI

As this project was one among four that responded to an LVIF call for proposals on addressing dimensions of gender inequalities and barriers in the LVVC, and with similar start and end times, the Responsible Officer brought the cohort together at regular intervals to exchange and share learnings with high turnout. The goal was to build a body of evidence and comparable results that can have greater impact and policy influence and create opportunities for joint capacity building. It also fostered deeper shared learning, stimulated peer-to-peer exchanges, cross-project learning and collaboration across countries and projects. Feedback from the teams indicated it was a value add to their projects and a positive experience. All the projects adapted, clarified, and strengthened their methodologies through their participation in the cohort, and collaborating on advocacy contributed to stronger impacts. Inviting in outside experts to presentation and critique provided opportunities for project reflections.

Once COVID-19 related restrictions eased and fieldwork resumed, the CoP meetings ceased as teams were suddenly very busy and catching up on lost time. Had there been a point person to lead collaborative activities on each team, the CoP momentum might have been sustained. There were also suggestions to have technical projects (upstream) involved in the cohort from the start to facilitate interaction and mutual learning between gender/social scientists and product development-focused scientists, which would have allowed them to adapt their projects to the learning along the way, instead of waiting to have the first full LVIF learning event in November of 2022 and at the end of the programme in November 2023. The projects also reflected that there would be an opportunity for much more cross-project synthesis, leveraging the significant body of comparable evidence that was generated across all four projects. Facilitating this in the context of EFPs, given project timelines and funding envelopes, is a challenge for IDRC to reflect upon.

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

The project was asked to include a risk assessment and propose mitigation measures. Almost all risk mitigation measures were applied and were effective. The unanticipated risk was the COVID-19 pandemic, and the team worked within their limits to work virtually where it was possible, and shifted to writing their implementation strategies in the first year of covid where field work was impossible. IDRC granted an extension which allowed them to complete the activities and milestones.

Gender-based violence was identified as a major obstacle preventing women from participating in livestock vaccination and decision making. The team was not trained to advise and support GBV victims and there were no readily available partners working at the project sights to help address the issue. They discussed hiring a consultant, and worked through the issues as they came up, finding that community conversations helped work through those conversations. This was common across the cohort, and something that IDRC POs should monitor closely in the case of projects with gender-transformative ambitions, and have resources available to support projects uncovering this issue.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

The team ensured at every stage of the project that they had IRB approval, and periodically submitted amendments. All their students did CITI ethics training, and research training continuously throughout the project (i.e., authorship training). They ensured every new cohort of students went through research ethics training. Ethics was important to the team.

They sought written informed consent from all stakeholder and from parents/guardians in the case of minors, and participants were informed of their rights to withdraw from the study at any time. Local authorities and county leaders were consulted in all areas prior to engagement with the communities, and research team members ensured they were oriented to cultural sensitivities.

This team really valued their stakeholders and country team members and included them in their publications. Many of their publications are first authored by in-country team members or graduate students. It took considerably more time to get their publications out as compared to some of the other projects as the more experienced and published writers in the team took the time to work with the less experienced writers and junior team members to be lead authors. Their aim was to ensure that they acknowledge their in-country expertise.

## Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

This project was funded through the Livestock Vaccine Innovation Fund (LVIF), which was co-funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), Global Affairs Canada (GAC) and IDRC. The fund was a 57$ CAD partnership of 8 years. It ended in March 2024. The Fund initially had a huge interest from GAC to have projects reaching women farmers while BMGF were less interested in the downstream type projects. BMGF did demonstrate a lot of interest as the projects moved along. A gender specialist working group was created by IDRC to discuss the best way to incorporate gender into the vaccine value chain for animals through a Call for Proposals. One of the main recommendations that came along was requiring gender leads as the PIs (not vaccine expert). Therefore, IDRC launched a closed call for proposals on addressing dimensions of gender inequalities and barriers in the livestock vaccine value chain. This project was one of 4 selected projects. IDRC really adopted a cohort approach with bringing the 4 projects together on a regular interval. The teams were also asked by IDRC to adopt the Women's Empowerment in Livestock Index (WELI) tool to create the possibility of meta-analysis for stronger data and greater impact of findings on women's empowerment.

This research team was an outstanding team who fully met all their objectives. They received a scaling supplement to work on potential avenues for scaling their delivery models which showed good results. This team came with the LVIF team to GAC to present their results and received valuable feedback on items that they need to work on to scale their model. Throughout the research all stakeholders were involved in all aspects of the research process. The project placed a significant emphasis on the inclusion of early career researchers with nine master's students well embedded in the research. This team opted to not use the (women empowerment livestock indicator (WELI) has they felt it did not meet their indicators; it is the only team of the cohort of 4 projects to not use the WELI. The principal investigator has also participated in some events of InnoVet-AMR as a gender expert.

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

This PCR emphasizes the importance of aligning technical interventions with gender transformative interventions to support long-term gender equality. It highlights the significance of providing gender training to technical stakeholders, including the research team, to challenge gender inequity and improve resource access and control for women. By addressing structural barriers and shifting constraining norms, the project aims to make a significant impact within a relatively short period of time.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC·CRDI

As part of the LVIF and gender project cohort, this initiative contributed to the IDRC's vision of promoting gender equality by empowering women through training and resource access. It specifically focuses on preventing emerging infectious diseases and zoonotic diseases, thereby enhancing livestock health, productivity, and women's economic empowerment and leadership. The project aligned with the CRFS and IDRC's gender equality Framework, promoting gender-transformative approaches with high potential to change existing gender norms.

The PCR summary indicates that effective risk mitigation measures were implemented. Like all projects during 2020-2021, the COVID-19 pandemic posed an unanticipated risk. The team adapted by working virtually and adjusting implementation strategies. IDRC granted an extension, allowing the project to complete its activities and milestones.
