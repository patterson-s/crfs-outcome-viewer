# Project Abstract

The Cultivate Africa's Future Fund (CultiAF) is a partnership between IDRC and the Australian Centre for International Agriculture Research that was created in 2013. The first phase of CAD $ 15M funded 8 projects in 5 countries (Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Kenya, and Uganda). The second phase of the fund (CultiAF 2) of CAD $ 20 was signed on June 30 as part of a 10-year partnership between the two organizations. The main objective of CultiAF 2 was to improve food and nutrition security in Eastern and Southern Africa by funding applied research to develop and scale up sustainable, climate resilient and gender responsive innovations for smallholder producers. CultiAF 2 focused on four key priorities: (i) increasing productivity of smallholder farmers and reducing post-harvest loss, (ii) improving nutrition (iii) climate resilience and sustainable management of water for agriculture and (iv) empowering women in agriculture. CultiAf 2 also funded the scaling up of selected innovations from CultiAF 1. The program focused geographically in Eastern and Southern Africa on the 10 countries of focus for CultiAF 1 (Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Rwanda and Burundi).

The research integration project covered three activities (i) inception and closing workshops. The former was intended to bring together all selected project teams to get an understanding of the project portfolio within the program, align approaches (e.g., inception workshops, gender integration, private sector engagement), and promote cross project collaboration. The closing workshop was intended for joint dissemination of and learning from the generated knowledge. (ii) External evaluation to assess the efficiency, effectiveness, and the impact of the program; and (iii) communication. All the three activities were successfully implemented. At the joint inception workshop, research teams were, as a first step, trained in gender integration, Pro-WEAI and communication. The joint inception workshop resulted in cross-project collaborations, and scaling of innovations across countries. For example, improved fish processing technologies were scaled from Malawi to Uganda while the precooked beans technology was adopted by 8 private sector companies and reached seven countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, including Ghana, by program closure. The Pro-WEAI and gender training enabled project teams to apply the pro-WEAI tool to identify disempowering factors for women and to implement gender responsive interventions that promoted empowerment of women and youth. Additionally, a variety of communication products were developed and disseminated at both project and program level, creating visibility for ACIAR and IDRC work in the region. Owing to the enhanced communication capacity of research teams, the project teams disseminated the evidence generated widely

through local and regional media pathways (see a detailed list of project level communication outputs in the Final report to ACIAR, section 2). Findings of the external evaluation results affirmed that CultiAF was gender responsive, employed strong environmental safeguards to respond to the food and nutrition security needs in the region, and informed policies and national food regulatory frameworks. Future programming would need to quantify economic impact better, allow for longer project time frames, improve monitoring of outputs and measurement of overall outcomes, among others. Details are captured in the evaluation report, a link is provided in the project outputs.

# PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

- A performance, monitoring and evaluation strategy was developed to guide effective implementation of the program. The strategy presented the logic model, the performance monitoring matrix, and the evaluation plan with a specified time frame for the external evaluation. The performance monitoring matrix was important in enabling collection of data that was eventually fed into trackify. The strategy also laid out the rationale for integrating gender equality and environmental sustainability as cross-cutting issues in the program. It also provided guidance on the governance of the CultiAF fund, resource allocation and defined the target stakeholders and beneficiaries.

- Gender integration support: A key approach that was adopted by the program was the use of the Project-level Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (Pro-WEAI) tool across projects to track gender outcomes. The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) was hired to support research teams to implement Pro-WEAI. In addition to the initial training offered at the joint inception workshop, IFPRI assessed the needs of the project teams and based on these to set up a desk support. The desk support provided further training at mid-implementation and continuous support in guiding collection of gender sensitive data, data analysis and interpretation, and reviewing draft manuscripts before they were submitted. Nonetheless, projects implemented Pro-WEAI differently given the different capacities of teams. It was also noted that Pro-WEAI required significant investments in terms of time, human and financial resources, to levels that grantees had not previously anticipated. This was majorly because the use of Pro-WEAI was recommended after the projects were approved and teams had neither conceptualized nor budgeted for it. Additionally, the program held supplementary gender training for all teams deepen awareness on the importance of addressing gender-based inequalities, and disempowering factors. The enhanced capacities enabled teams to work with male and female community level 'gender champions' to implement gender responsive interventions.

- A communications strategy was developed by the CultiAF team (IDRC and ACIAR staff) with support from Wrenmedia. This strategy was key in guiding the remarkable knowledge translation that the program achieved. The strategy stipulated the deliverables, target audiences, roles of different actors (consultant, projects, funders) and the different communications products at specific time frames. The strategy underwent review mid-way following recommendations of the Governance Committee meeting of May 21, 2020, and was refined to ensure the strategy delivered beyond specific projects to include creating visibility for the IDRC-ACIAR partnership. The strategy included training project teams on how to communicate scientific research to non-science users, the use of social media, producing project profiles, aand stories from the field. The first communications training, held during the inception workshop in May 2019, focused on on how to key messages that effectively communicate their projects efficiently. At mid-implementation, when projects had some results, a second training was conducted to strengthen capacity of staff to communicate their results to different stakeholders. Additional trainings were event specific e.g., presenting research progress and adjustments made to project implementation due to the impacts of COVID-19 at a CultiAF webinar in May 2020, presenting results at the CultiAF closing conference in Nairobi in June 2023. A diversity of communication products that were

generated by the program are indicated in the Final Technical Report to ACIAR (see outputs in section 2).

- External evaluation: The performance monitoring framework provided for an external evaluation at mid-term program implementation. The evaluation was intended to (i) assess progress/results against planned outcome targets, and (ii) inform future programming. The evaluation, undertaken in May 2021 by Le Groupe-conseil Baastel, highlights key achievements, challenges and lessons that inform future programming. A link to the evaluation report is provided in the outputs.
- CultiAF closing workshop: While the joint inception workshop was critical for building coherence in the program portfolio, enhancing capacity of researchers, and promoting collaboration across projects, the closing workshop (conference) was focused on knowledge translation - consolidating program results and disseminating them to multiple stakeholders. The closing event was delivered as a regional conference titled "Cultivating Africa's Future Food Systems: Enabling Resilient, Equitable and Sustainable Food Systems" in June, 2023 in Nairobi, Kenya. Conference outputs were fed into the CultiAF program synthesis. The synthesis helped to bring together the lessons from the program, depicting what worked well, what did not work well and could be improved, and what should probably not be repeated in future programming. Thus, the synthesis supported the dissemination of CultiAF results and outcomes.

## 3. If appropriate, explain why outputs were not completed or were of poor quality.

Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

All the anticipated outputs were completed and are of high quality. The diverse range of outputs such as scientific publications and communication products (see details in Final report to ACIAR) are testament that the research integration project delivered more outputs than originally anticipated. For example, the project supported the Program Synthesis, which was not one of the targeted deliverables. Additionally, some outputs e.g., communication products were disseminated widely to different user audiences through IDRC newsletters, funding partner websites and various social media campaigns on gender, climate, and food security, to mention but a few. The Cultivate Africa's Future: achievements and impacts video gives a glimpse of what was achieved.

# PROJECT OUTCOMES

## 4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

**Strengthened gender integration.** A gender integration strategy/approach was developed to guide gender integration in the program. The AFS gender strategy was modified to fit the objectives of CultiAF II, based on lessons learnt from CultiAF I. The strategy highlighted the need for training of project teams at inception and mid-implementation and use of the Pro-WEAI approach, including and peer-to-peer learning mechanism across projects. The trainings and peer-to-peer learning sessions were very instrumental in ensuring that projects integrated gender effectively in the research cycle, realizing impressive gender outcomes. The Pro-WEAI tool was particularly important in helping projects to identify disempowerment factors, which in turn helped them to target counteractive interventions. A few examples are highlighted in this media **story** from the filed. This research-in-action **article** explains that gender equality was integrated in the program design, which resulted in positive outcomes despite Covid-19 exacerbating inequalities.

**Strong knowledge translation.** CultiAF aligned well with the strategic objective of disseminating knowledge for broader uptake and utilization, making a significant contribution to IDRC's knowledge sharing efforts that influence national, regional, and global development agendas. Examples of how CultiAF innovations were changing lives of end-users were shared internally at the June 2022 Town Hall, the 2023 Annual Public Meeting, were included in IDRC's **Annual Report 2021-2022**, were shared widely through the centre's Corporate Communications channels, the ESARO regional **newsletter**, and other social media (**CultiAF impacts video**). Also, the awareness created and the enhanced capacities among project teams resulted in wider dissemination of research evidence at local and national levels. All these channels helped to disseminate the knowledge created to a diverse range of users and raise the visibility of IDRC and ACIAR as funding institutions as well as the CultiAF partnership between the two Institutions.

**Increased private sector collaboration.** CultiAF II was constituted by a mix of new and scaling projects that rolled over from Phase I. This necessitated a strong integration of the private sector for knowledge co-creation, scaling and ensuring sustainability of the innovations. The performance framework and communications strategy made provisions to ensure that the integration was weaved into the research cycle and the dissemination of findings. Key private sector partners that the projects worked with included input suppliers, crop insurance companies, agri-machinery fabricators, food/feed processors and distributors, food vendors, supermarkets, financial/credit institutions, mobile phone service providers, and digital App developers/proprietors. Some categories included a diversity of actors. For example, input suppliers constitute seed and fertilizer dealers, suppliers of fruit fly traps and baits, solar drier materials, soil water monitoring tools, green houses, etc. Significant contributions of the private sector in the program included innovative financing, and provision of materials, markets, and insurance. The engagement process also yielded important lessons for future programming.

**Informing future programming.** I highlight here three key lessons that we learnt from this research project. First, effective knowledge translation requires a dedicated effort and expertise that cannot be provided by program officers, who may not have the necessary expertise and the time to commit. CultiAF benefited greatly from working with an independent knowledge translation partner. POs remained engaged by reviewing communication products to ensure that the technical aspects were correct. Second, the use of common tools or approaches, e.g., Pro-WEAI, across projects must be integrated at conceptualization of the research idea, not later in the research process. This helps the research team to incorporate the tool in the research methodology, provide the necessary budget, procure the necessary expertise, and integrate it in the implementation plan. This is important fostering interest, commitment, and ownership from the research team. Third, private sector should be involved at the idea conceptualisation stage so that they co-create the research process and outputs with the researchers. This results in a project that is designed to meet the interests of key stakeholders, for example, scientific, business and food security outcomes. The INSFEED project is a good example that explains this – strong science outputs,

provided cheaper protein for the livestock feed industry, and a cheaper organic fertilizer for crop producers. The private sector and all stakeholders came on board at initial stages of the research.

5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

The intended results of the project were more than anticipated with respect to the three project activities, resulting in positive outcomes. Only the program evaluation happened as originally planned. We diversified the objectives of the joint inception workshop to include training on gender integration and the use of the Pro-WEAI tool. The training formed a backbone of a series of capacity enhancement initiatives that would accompany project implementation. The closing workshop was upgraded to a regional closing conference for learning, evidence dissemination and celebrating the 10-year partnership between ACIAR and IDRC. Similarly, the communications component was also adjusted, following the governance committee recommendations, to broaden from a projects' focus to include amplifying the partnership. Section 4 provides some details on this.

Four out of nine CultiAF II research projects were scaling proven innovations that were rolled over from CultiAF I. This necessitated that they work with the private sector, which would help in scaling the innovations. Based on their respective context and objectives, some projects were set to scale while others tested scaling models. We extended this perspective to the new projects and required them to identify and work with private sector actors such that scaling became an integral part of the research process. This mix helped us to draw valuable lessons.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic/core objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.

Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project was developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

This research support project contributed mainly to the strategic objective of sharing knowledge for greater uptake and use. Earlier sections have elaborated, with examples, the diverse ways in which this project contributed. Notably, knowledge was shared with local, regional, and global audiences through various communication channels, including audiences in Canada and Australia. Knowledge exchange and application among research teams in the different countries was boundless and is evidenced by the scaling of the innovations.

To a moderate extent, albeit with large impact, the project contributed to the strategic objective of mobilizing alliances for impact, mainly at local and national levels. The rating of 'moderate' implies that the project did not specifically target other donors. However, the impact was substantial because all projects in the portfolio were implemented by partnerships involving private sector actors, civil society, public and private research institutions, policy and regulatory institutions, and farmers. These partnerships were important for enabling research action at local level, catalysing scaling at sub-national and influencing policy at national level and among different target countries.

## FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

The evaluation generated some lessons that relate to this RSP. IDRC staff observed that some research teams needed to enhance their skills in financial accounting. This would reduce the time spent on monitoring risks and hand holding. Additionally, some grantees reported having experienced challenges developing on multi-partner budgets and agreeing on teaming

arrangements at the proposal development stage. A few grantees were dissatisfied with the IDRC withholding 10% of the budget until project activities were completed.

Grantees recommended longer project time frames to allow for developing partnerships and interdisciplinary teams, scaling of innovations, and policy engagement. The short project timeline led to inability to capture impacts by project closure.

My observation points to the disadvantage we experience by a complete halt of engagement with grantees soon after project closure. Other than the scientific publications they continue to share, we miss out on the impacts of the innovations among users, and on learning to ascertain what catalyzes adoption of those innovations – use beyond the project target areas and populations. Since we never conduct impact studies, we could invest in longer term projects e.g., five years and study what works with intention to plough lessons in programming. The other option is to do multi-phase implementation of successful innovations and again draw lessons. Cutting off ties at project closure is neither good for the grantees nor informative for our programming.

# STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

Potential risks described in the RSP were related to (i) inability to identify organizations that have the required skills to support the communications and conduct the evaluation, and that (ii) the firm selected to provide communications support to the program may not have all the necessary skills and expertise given the broad nature of support required by the program, and that performance of projects may be varied across the different phases of the program.

The risk mitigation strategies were effective, and all work was completed in time. Procurement and selection process for both the communications support the program evaluation were started and concluded in time, which enabled us to identify appropriate organizations. In both cases, detailed TORs were developed and shared together with targeted organizations with an invitation to submit an expression of interest. The selection of WRENmedia to support communications was a great opportunity that enabled a seamless build up of outputs, outcomes and impacts from where CultiAF I had left. The communications strategy and a detailed action plan guided on the diversity of communications products that would be delivered at specific timelines, aligned to project, and program outputs. The action plan and associated deliverables were reviewed every six months and adjustments made as needed. Additionally, WRENmedia provided an initial list of country-based journalists and networks that we simply built on during project implementation. These were helpful in writing field-based success stories from the projects and interacting with research teams.

Baastel, the firm selected to conduct the evaluation, had previously worked with some CRFS programs. This made it easy to understand IDRC and the diversity of the work we do, even though CultiAF was new to the evaluators. The evaluation was conducted virtually due to COVID-19 impacts.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

This project was not a research project. As such, it did not have did not have any unforeseen ethical issues.

Program Leaders/Managers should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

# Director comments

The relevant Program or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

Over the years, Cultiaf has become a cornerstone of the IDRC's agriculture for development and food security program. The synthesis and support provided to connect grantees beyond individual project outcomes at a more programmatic level was a critical tool. This not only aligned Cultiaf with the changes occurring between strategic cycles at IDRC but also catalyzed the impact of the projects and assisted future programming to better integrate strategic objectives such as gender, private sector, and knowledge translation.

This PCR is an exceptional example of how to integrate learning beyond the final event of an EFP. The team developed a comprehensive strategy aligned with IDRC's corporate strategy objectives and worked with grantees and consultants to identify gaps and build capacities. As presented in this PCR, it is possible to integrate gender equality approaches at any stage and in any kind of intervention. This Research Support Project (RSP) was being developed concurrently as the IDRC program team drafted the gender equality and inclusion framework. The team did not wait for the completion of the framework to integrate gender equality principles and training. Using existing tools such as Pro-WEIA was the right decision, proving the role of IDRC in connecting global institutions' capacity, such as IFPRI, with national and local researchers in an actionable product.

The final event evolved into more than a series of results presentations; it was a networking and learning opportunity complemented by the final reports, evaluations, and individual project media products.

This PCR summarizes a model and lessons that must be adopted across programs at EFPs or small-medium bets. Many of the lessons identified by the Project Officer in this PCR are critical to ensure our project-to-program shift. In particular, a comment made by the Project Officer about the difficulty of closing projects too soon or not having mechanisms to continue supporting and engaging with grantees after the "short" research period to monitor better and understand the impact and facilitate the process of private sector engagement, solutions adoption, and real change on people's lives beyond scientific publications. The Project Officer provides two very valid options to be evaluated in a new modality of IDRC's granting:

- We could invest in longer-term projects, e.g., five years, and study what works to collect lessons into programming.
- The other option is the multi-phase implementation of successful innovations and, again, drawing lessons. Cutting off ties at project closure is neither good for the grantees nor informative for our programming.

Perhaps we have to start a funding modality of 0+3+2. Where year 0 is focused on building partnerships, capacities, and co-development, 3 years are focused on producing research results, and 1 to 2 years are post-project follow-up, learning, evaluating impact, and bringing to scale.

I approve this PCR
