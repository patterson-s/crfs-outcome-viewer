# Project Abstract

Infectious diseases associated with poultry farming and egg production pose high health risks to farmers and consumers. It can also negatively affect the poultry industry of any given country. In Kenya, poultry farming represents about 30% of the total agriculture contribution to its GDP. Salmonella infections in poultry farms are currently controlled using antibiotics. Antibiotics are also used at sub-therapeutic doses to increase the growth rate of chickens and improve feed efficiency. An estimated 75% of antibiotics administered to poultry are released into the environment, and this has been shown to contribute to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial resistance is a growing concern in Salmonella and poses increasing threats. Therefore, alternatives to antibiotics are needed.

This project aims to investigate bacteriophage-based solutions to kill Salmonella strains isolated from poultry farms in Kenya. The project will be divided into six work packages: 1) Collect Salmonella from poultry farms and slaughterhouses in Kenya and type strains for antibiotic resistance genes; 2) Test known bacteriophages for their capacity to lyse selected Kenyan Salmonella strains; 3) Isolate new bacteriophages from Kenya with lytic activity towards Kenyan Salmonella strains. 4) Test combinations of bacteriophages in a Salmonella infection model in chickens. 5) Conduct field trials using bacteriophages in selected smallholder farms. 6) Assess the impact of bacteriophage technology and adoption by women chicken farmers. This proposal includes new commercial alternative products to antibiotics for the prevention and control of infections that could be adapted and accepted by the Kenyan poultry industry. The research team expects to develop a phage delivery system to improve protection against Salmonella strains isolated from Kenya.

# PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

- The research team has collected various samples from poultry farms and slaughterhouses in Kenya to characterize *Salmonella enterica* strains and phages. A total of 16 *Salmonella* strains and 67 new phages were isolated and characterized. Among the phages isolated are phages with the incredible ability to kill specific *Salmonella* strains. This pioneering study developed a phage cocktail composed of 4 phages chosen based on genomic analyses, host range diversity, and *in vitro* efficacy in reducing the growth of Kenyan *Salmonella* strains.

- The selected phage cocktail showed notable efficiency against the tested *Salmonella* strains in broilers and Kienyegi chicken. Field trials conducted in Kenya have shown that the phage cocktail can be successfully administered orally and conveniently given to chicken by mixing it with daily drinking water. Thus, the phage cocktail could represent an interesting alternative to antibiotics in the fight against *Salmonella* infection in the poultry industry and reduce the risk of illness due to the bacterium.

- Furthermore, three out of 4 phages included in the cocktail were successfully spray-dried to manufacture as a powdered product that can be conveniently shipped and distributed, avoiding a cold chain. The production of the other phage as a spray-dried powder will need to be further investigated.

- More importantly, the gender study conducted by the research team has provided vital information to identify women farmers as a target group to improve our project and facilitate acceptance by the chicken farmer community in Kenya.

- All relevant results, findings, and conclusions were disseminated to the scientific community and the public using various channels, including publication in 5 peer-reviewed open-access journals, three keynote presentations, and six poster presentations at national and international scientific venues.

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?
Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

The misuse of antibiotics in animal production to combat infectious diseases has led to the development of antimicrobial resistance in many bacteria, compromising the ability to manage and cure important infectious diseases effectively. In many LMICs, *Salmonella* infections in poultry farms are currently controlled using antibiotics. Antibiotics are also used at sub-therapeutic doses to increase the growth rate of chickens and improve feed efficiency. Due to this rising problem of antimicrobial resistance, it is necessary to focus on safe and eco-friendly alternatives, such as using bacteriophages (or phages) for therapeutic or biocontrol purposes in Kenyan chicken farming.

This highly innovative project has allowed the characterization of *Salmonella* strains and phages from Kenyan poultry farms and slaughterhouses. The project allowed the manufacturing of a spray-dried powder made of a 4-phages cocktail (2 phages from Kenya and two from the University Laval phage collection) that possesses significant lytic activity on Kenyan *Salmonella* strains.

The team also investigated the gender roles in preventing Salmonella in the poultry industry in rural Kenya, providing vital information to identify women farmers as a target group to improve the project and facilitate acceptance of phage-based products by the chicken farmer community in Kenya. The project contributed to the current literature on the use of phages for therapeutic proposes via the publication of 5 open access peer-reviewed manuscripts as well as dissemination of the study findings in the form of oral or poster presentations in several scientific forums.

5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently, as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

The primary goal of this project was to develop a phage product utilizing a combination of phages selected for their capability to kill specific Salmonella strains, including those isolated from poultry farms in Kenya. Initially, the research team had envisioned administering the product through feed, intending to assist chickens in coping with Salmonella infection. However, after consultation discussions with women farmers in Kenya, it became evident that a product delivered through drinking water would be more appealing to them due to the varying degrees of feed quality available to farmers. This led to a shift in the targeted product delivery form. Consequently, a phage product in the form of powder to be administered to the chicken's drinking water was developed. The experience underscores the importance of actively involving intended end users in the early stage of exploration for product development, particularly when devising innovative solutions for implementation in low- and middle-income countries.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.

Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

Large-scale positive change:

This project provided proof of concept of phage technology for fighting bacterial infections, which represents a safer alternative to antibiotics. The impact on smallholder beneficiaries may not be immediate, but it addresses an important gap regarding the lack of innovative technological solutions to address some of IDRC's Development Outcomes, especially "improving health for all." Phage therapy is already being used to treat human infections with multi-resistant bacteria. Several bacteriophages with the ability to lyse Salmonella have been identified worldwide, including in Canada. A few of these phages have been tested in experimental chickens, showing safety and substantial efficacy in reducing bacterial infections and increasing the survival rate of Salmonella-infected chickens. This project led by Laval University has developed a phage product that can potentially be a new commercial alternative to antibiotics for the prevention and control of Salmonella infections that could be adapted and accepted by the Kenyan poultry industry. It will also, therefore, contribute to the development outcome of "enhancing food and nutrition security" by reducing animal losses from disease and contributing to a sustainable animal health system for the future.

Supporting leaders of today and tomorrow:

This project helped provide solid training on phage technology to 2 postdocs based at ILRI in Kenya and one postdoc based in Laval, Canada. Those trainees have received the expertise needed for an independent career as principal investigators on the research topic. One research associate

from ILRI and two based in Laval participated directly in the research, which helped them acquire the skills needed in scientific research.

## Partner of choice:

The project was funded through a donor-partnership program comprising IDRC and the UK Government's Global AMR Innovation Fund (GAMRIF) – managed by the UK Department of Health and Social Care. In addition, the InnoVet-AMR Call for Proposals encouraged effective partnerships to better coordinate discovery, development, and sustainable delivery of the proposed veterinary solutions.

The research team included one principal investigator from an institution based in a low- and middle-income country and a second from Canada. This project highlights the strengths of IDRC in supporting southern partners in exploring and delivering sustainable solutions to smallholder farmers' challenges in Africa. It also offers a continuous opportunity for IDRC to partner with institutions in Kenya and East Africa.

## FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

The project was funded by a grant amounting to CAD $2,909,200.00 over 33 months. In response to challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, InnoVet-AMR projects were granted an 18-month no-cost extension to enable them to catch up on their research activities. Later, the project received an additional supplement, bringing the total grant value to CAD $3,308,000.

To accelerate project completion, the Principal Investigator (PI) acquired a vital piece of equipment for the project, incurring a cost of approx. CAD $19K. Unfortunately, the PI did not secure prior approval from IDRC before making this purchase, citing a lack of awareness regarding the necessary authorization. The PI has since been informed of the proper procedures to follow. Acknowledging that the team has been chosen to receive funding for the second phase of InnoVet-AMR, the Program Officer in charge of the project has agreed to allow the team to continue utilizing the equipment, with the condition that it be sent to their Kenyan partner at the conclusion of the project.

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC·CRDI

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

- One of the anticipated risks is related to the nature of the exploratory product development project, which presents the probability of not reaching the expected outcome. The research teams have provided and implemented a risk mitigation plan that has allowed the project to proceed. The team provided detailed technical reports on time and was very keen to provide all the documents we thought necessary. In addition, the IDRC program officers overseeing the project have maintained regular communication with the research team via laboratory visits.

- The COVID-19 pandemic was one unforeseen risk. The closure of research facilities for more than a year resulted in significant delays and disturbances in research activities. The ILRI farm, where the experimentation was planned to take place, shut down for several months on March 17th, 2020, due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Ongoing animal studies had to be terminated, and planned animal studies had to be postponed until farm staff could resume back to work in late July of that same year. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic also affected procuring chickens due to country-wide curfews, which significantly delayed conducting the planned animal studies. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that the impact of the pandemic was lessened by the 18-month extension.

- Unfortunately, COVID's effects were more severe than expected and had a negative effect on the project. The usual challenge of getting reagents and lab supplies in Kenya worsened during COVID-19, and prices for lab supplies were significantly higher.

- The ILRI farm closed again for one month during the Kenyan general election (July - August 2022) for security issues, which again delayed the start of some animal experiments. During the general election, government ministries, such as the one granting import and export permits, worked slower, delaying approvals. It also affected internal services such as the IACUC committee.

Despite those challenges, the research team has shown incredible resilience and adaptability and managed to achieve the objectives of the project.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

No ethical issues arose from the project.

## Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

This project was one of eleven IDRC funded projects which were developed through the Innovative Veterinary Solutions for antimicrobial resistance (InnoVet-AMR), a partnership with the UK Department of Health and Social Care (UK-DHSC). The objective of this initiative was to develop alternatives (including vaccines) to antibiotics in the veterinary sector. This project was 1 of 2 focusing on developing bacteriophage as alternative to antibiotics in the poultry sector. The project is based in Kenya. The focus of the InnoVet-AMR 2.0 was to develop new products and therefore a series of training opportunities was developed by IDRC to accompany the research

teams in the product development process toward commercialization. This project provided proof of concept of phage technology for fighting bacterial infections, which represents a safer alternative to antibiotics. Before finalizing the project and the program, a new phase has been negotiated with the UK-DHSC: InnoVet-AMR 2.0. A component of this new program will be to continue funding the projects of InnnoVet-AMR1.0 within a second phase. This project will be able to apply for a phase 2 funding in this new phase of funding.

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

As presented in this PCR, the opportunity to use bacteriophages as an alternative to antibiotics is a promising strategy, and the grantees' work has yielded excellent results. This project is a model for integrating a gender equality and inclusion framework into upstream technological innovation. The multidisciplinary team successfully identified a delivery model that would be more acceptable to the end users, particularly women, acknowledging the importance of understanding gender dynamics in animal management for adopting and scaling technological solutions. During my visit to the Nairobi team at ILRI, I was impressed by their professionalism and dedication. The collaboration between ILRI and Laval University exemplifies a strong partnership between Canadian researchers and a CGIAR center. The grantees have also effectively engaged with local actors to ensure the research's relevance and localization. The promising results of this project have paved the way for a new phase in the new partnerships between IDRC and UK-DHSC. I approve this PCR, Santiago Alba-Corral, Director CRFS.
