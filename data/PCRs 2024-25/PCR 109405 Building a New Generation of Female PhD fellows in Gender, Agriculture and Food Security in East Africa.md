# Project Abstract

Globally, researchers are important drivers of knowledge production and innovation to support economic growth and improve lives. However, Africa lags the rest of the world in scientific output – producing 1% of the world's scientific publications. The continent faces a severe shortage of researchers, particularly at the PhD level and above. This project will support up to 10 female PhD researchers with research and travel grants to carry out research at the nexus of gender, agriculture and food security. There is a persistent gender gap in the number of researchers with women representing only 30% of PhD holders in African countries. Women continue to face many unique barriers to postgraduate education including constrained mobility, skewed allocation of resources, unconscious bias and pervasive sexism within academia. The area of gender, agriculture and food security is also relatively poorly funded and researched. This project addresses the clear need for interventions to increase the funding and training for African female academics while growing the body of work on gender and agriculture research. The Ideas Institute's PhD Scholars programme provides a local research funding source (research grant) for young women undertaking PhD studies in the East African region, alongside a comprehensive package of support to increase their research and professional skills, deepen their networks, access mentorship from both peers and experts, and develop their leadership potential and visibility within and outside the academy. This combination of support can be a critical tool for the empowerment of women scientists and to unlocking the underutilized potential of women by infusing new talent, energy and perspectives into research, policy making and public discourse. The PhD Scholars will be further supported to submit their research to academic publications, present their research at local and international conferences, and secure additional funding from external sources. The key outputs and outcomes of the project will include 10 young women working on gender and agriculture research, a special issue in a journal of gender and agriculture research in the East Africa region, various policy and op-ed articles in the media, a network of gender and agriculture researchers, and more recognition of women researchers in agriculture.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

1. The project contributed to the professionals' action of some 40 women fellows, all PhD students from across the East African region. Out of the 40 fellows, 21 are specifically working on the gender, agriculture, climate and food security nexus. To contribute positively to fellows' career aspirations, the program addressed both the strengthening of core research and academic competencies, and a comprehensive professional development training and support. Therefore, areas of activities during the fellowship included training and resources to produce high quality research; training in ethics in research; Internet and data security; participatory action research; and gender lens for researchers. In addition, the program proposed a series of professional courses on budgeting and financial management; academic writing and publishing; grants development; policy and public engagement; science communication; and career and leadership. As a result, some 14 external grants were secured by fellows, 4 additional awards (including two L'Oréal-UNESCO for Women in Science sub-Saharan Africa Young Talents Awards).

2. Scientific production of the fellows was a highlight of the program, with 2 books co-authored by fellows, and 35 articles published in recognised journals, out of which, 11 have received coverage by international and local media. Fellows have meaningfully participated in a total of 75 national and international events including workshops, conferences, panel discussions, seminars and training.

3. The project improved the perception of the fellows on their strength, skills and capacities in research, policy engagement and science communication. It contributed to alleviate challenging conditions that limit women's progress towards their PhDs, and that were identified by the fellows at the early stage of their fellowship such as: 'Feeling as if your work is not taken seriously because of your gender', 'Lacking access to research funding opportunities', 'Struggling to successfully collaborate with other researchers' and 'Struggling to balance work and family commitments', as reported they reported towards the end of the project.

4. The project strengthened networks and improved access to mentorship of early-career women in research. The project guaranteed that all fellows would be matched to a mentor, while only 64% of the fellows had mentors prior to the fellowship. These mentors managed to connect fellows to experts in their field, and doubled the number of fellows that could receive networking support. For example, during one of the Mawazo networking event in November 2022 the graduating fellows had the possibility to showcase their research to the wider Mawazo network (including supporters, partners, and funders). They also discussed their "Commitments to Actions" a reflection on how they envision their big ideas and research could help solve Africa's current and emerging development challenges.

5. Through the project, women fellows increased their representation skills, visibility, influence and impact, many of them increasing their public presence and contributing to influence positively their respective field. For example, one fellow produced educational videos for N*Gen Television on Water and Cities in Nairobi, a television channel that has a wide viewership among children. Another fellow developed an AI for storytelling and archiving of African myths, legends and folktales, which she has used as a basis for a start-up - LESOStories. She is also a lecturer at a Nairobi University, and is inspiring an entire class of tech

designer students pursuing diplomas and degrees. One Fellow was invited to present her work at a research seminar organised by National Drought Management Authority (NDMA), a public body in Kenya mandated to coordinate management of drought risks that had injected 8 million into research for scientifically proven solutions to the challenges facing arid lands. As well as putting her in contact with public sector stakeholders invested in producing solutions, the event was covered in two national media platforms in Kenya, the Star and the Nation, increasing the visibility and potential impact of her work.

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?
Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

Mawazo aims to tackle the underrepresentation and exclusion of women from Africa's research and higher-education sector in the field of agriculture and food security, which is among the most pressing development priorities in sub-Saharan Africa. The agricultural sector is also at the centre of a number of emerging crises, including rising demand for food, given population and income growth dynamics, climate change and environmental degradation, and an expanding youth population requiring employment. Through an online training and professional development programme, it strives at incubating female-led research and thought leadership at the nexus of agriculture, food security, and gender to encourage their participation in every stage of the research to action pipeline in both the public and private sectors. Doing this, the project contributed to filling the gaps left by many local higher education institutions in order to prepare young women researchers to be future thought leaders and public fellows who have impact and visibility both within and outside the academy.

The project contributed to several Sustainable Development Goals, including:
- SDG 4: Quality Education
- SDG 5: Gender Equality
- SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth
- SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (especially Target 9.5, to substantially increase the number of research and development workers per one million people, and Target 9.b, to support domestic technology development, research and innovation in developing countries) and
- SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?
Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

Like all the projects that started before the COVID-19 pandemic, restructuration and changes had to be brought to the project. The team was very quick, in fact much quicker than many others in the same situation, to adapt to the new reality. They had to slightly postpone a few activities and reoriented their training to the online platform, with a few in person activities towards the end of the project.

The surveys built in the program helps them adjust very promptly the programme to meet beneficiaries' and the larger ecosystem's needs, which led to a few changes, including, for example:
- re-introduction of grant funding for specific research activities to accelerate the path to PhD for early career African women
- geographical expansion in order to reach and impact early career African women researchers across the whole continent, including francophone Africa.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC’s strategic objectives?
Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.
Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

Being a partner of choice for large scale impact: This project was in line with key priorities of IDRC and the Agriculture and Food Security Program to strengthen research at the intersection of gender, agriculture and food security and to support women working on this topic. It contributed to position the Centre as one of the key players in this field with fellow’s research projects that have direct application in the region and that were the subject of outreach and communication products. Fellows have co-authored 2 books and had 35 articles published in recognised journals. 11 of them have received coverage by international and local media.

Building leaders of today and tomorrow: The project responded directly to IDRC’s strategic priorities of building leaders for today and tomorrow. It specifically focused on building a cohort of highly trained policy-oriented female African thought leaders, who could add to timely and credible discussions relevant to agriculture, food security and gender in the public and decision-making spheres. This way, they are strategically positioned to contribute to finding homegrown solutions to the pressing development challenges. Doing so, the project contributed to remedy the under-representation of women by investing in young female fellows in East Africa, who face unique barriers to their participation and advancement in knowledge sectors, and who are poised to contribute innovative ideas and unique perspectives.

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

This project achieved a lot with little resource (only 200,000 CAD): the team managed to support 40 fellows and provide a wide range of trainings, outreach events and mentorship activities to develop both soft and hard scientific skills. Surveys and testimony all concur to the high quality of the program.

# STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

The team managed well the risks identified in the PAD, including expanding to the entire East African region and widening the advertisement to increase quality of the pool of applicants. Regarding the structural barriers faced by women, all women reported a reduction in the extent to which these challenges affected them. The pandemic risk wasn't addressed, but overall, the team managed very well the transition to the hybrid mode and the impacts was therefore reduced compared to other projects.

## Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

This is an impressive project with results exceeding expectations in terms of outputs and beneficiaries reached, especially early career women researchers, their networks and leadership development.

The academic outputs are many and would be challenging to synthesise and evaluate their collective or individual impact, however there can be confidence in the "value for money" of this effort to increase women's leadership and contributions to the field. The deliberate efforts to reduce isolation through mentorship, networking and training were clearly important.

We often remark on the value of conducting follow-up evaluations. Projects such as these, with their very likely widespread seeding of talent and leadership are really worthy of follow-up. It would be important also to reflect on the longer term benefits of this short term funding and what opportunities were created for continuity.

Team Leader, CRFS

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

With less than 20% of total global female researchers in agriculture, supporting women researchers in their careers is critical for future gender-transformative research. In sub-Saharan Africa, this approach is especially relevant, as presented by the PO in this PCR. The list of outputs and outcomes in this project is the result of a comprehensive approach to support the empowerment of women and the solid approach for research quality and research capacity that both the grantee and IDRC have facilitated during the implementation of this project.

In particular, the Mawazo Institute demonstrated an extraordinary adaptive capacity when COVID disrupted the project's initial plans. The grantee not only adapted its operations to a hybrid model, but its publications and research results also demonstrated its capacity to adapt the project's objectives to the reality surrounding the implementation.

I agree with the comments from the PL on the importance of a post-action evaluation to assess the long-term benefits accompanying the careers of many of the researchers supported by the project. This is an opportunity to learn and demonstrate the impact of IDRC when funding these kinds of projects.

I approve this PCR
