# Project Abstract

Sorghum provides staple food for more than 60 million people in Ethiopia. It is predominantly grown by some of Ethiopia's poorest smallholder farmers in the dry lowlands producing grain, forage, fuel and building materials, and is mainly used for domestic consumption. The production of surplus sorghum grain is possible through the use of inputs and improved varieties, but widespread use of such practices is limited by insufficient economic resources, high labour demand and environmental factors. Additionally, poor storage practices result in high losses due to insect pest damage and reduced grain quality due to fungal infestation. Climate change further contributes to a higher frequency of drought events and crop failures, exposing farmers to even greater food shortages and loss of livestock. Women provide much of the labour for the crop and play a major role in the sorghum trade; changes to the economics of sorghum can therefore directly impact women and children.

To address key limitations to sorghum production and availability to smallholders in Ethiopia, the project developed and deployed key technologies that reduce the risk of crop failure, increase productivity and create new economic opportunities for women businesses. The technologies include; climate smart sorghum varieties, value-added sorghum products, small-scale threshers, and farm-scale grain storage systems. This will improve the economic well-being of about 240,000 disadvantaged rural Ethiopians, particularly women and children. In addition, this project enhanced the Ethiopian Institute for Agricultural Research's capacity to breed drought tolerant sorghum varieties and use crop simulation modelling to increase plant breeding efficiency and evaluate the risk of genetic and agronomic interventions.

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

1. Building climate resilience: relying on rainfall to grow crops is no longer a viable option. Sorghum, though known for being a hardy crop, is becoming a challenge in Ethiopia given longer frequent droughts and the lack of water or moisture in the soil that occurs. The traditional varieties cannot withstand this moisture stress. This project addressed this challenge by undertaking a program that looked at what type of roots can support sorghum production in moisture stress condition, what kind of leaves can retain water and release more efficiently, and what varieties have the root architecture (RA) and the transpiration efficiency (TE) that will be required to ensure sorghum would ensure farmers have enough food and can also get it to market to boost their incomes even in prolonged drought periods. The root angles for the improved and newly released sorghum varieties ranged from 14.04 to 19.50 degrees, indicating that varieties with wider nodal root angle carry the risk of susceptibility to severe drought stress. This finding suggests that narrow root angle traits of sorghum genotypes lead to enhanced grain yield in drought-prone conditions. The test on transpiration efficiency led to selection of varieties that also have high biomass as sorghum is used for both food and feed. Varieties with high biomass were preferred by farmers who are also livestock keepers as they use it for food security for themselves and as fodder for their animals.

2. Enhanced productivity – Although sorghum production and productivity has shown an increasing trend in Ethiopia, the trend is not commensurate with the population growth. To rectify this, the project worked to avail varieties that could better withstand moisture stress, guided by factors of RA, TE and farmers' needs, thereby boosting productivity and making sorghum accessible and available to smallholder farmers. Demonstrations were held for seven early maturing improved varieties, Argity, Tilahun, Melkam, Kalu, Alene, Dekeba, Girana 1 and Fadis 0, in the project target areas. The performance of the improved technologies varied depending on the extent of drought and adaptation to specific environmental conditions. For instance, the mean performance in Arsi zone was 3.4 t/ha and in East Hararghe zone 4 t/ha with the yield advantage of 21% and 43%, respectively. Improved sorghum varieties showed an overall superior grain yield performance from 2.7 to 4.8 tons/ha. The average productivity of the improved varieties was 3.9 tons/ha, which was 44% higher than the conventional production.

3. Increased input availability: The on-farm demonstration revealed that the variety Melkam had wider acceptance than the variety Argity because Melkam is early flowering and withstands terminal stress. However, the variety Argity was found better in both grain yield and biomass production in good seasons and areas that have extended rainfall. Based on the demand from the growers and seed producers, different classes of seed were multiplied and delivered to seed growers and farmers. The project targeted multiplication of 400 kg breeder and 10 tons of pre-basic seed classes. For the variety Melkam, Argity and Girana-1 a total of 697 kg and 15.3 tons breeder and pre basic seed classes, respectively. In addition, 208 Tonnes of certified and quality declared seed (QDS) were produced through the formal seed system and community seed growing schemes. The seed multiplied through the formal and informal seed systems was extended to farmers through large scale demonstration (LSD), small seed packs and farmer-to-farmer seed exchange. In total, 8523 farmers, 16% of whom were women headed households owning farmland, directly accessed the improved varieties through LSD and small seed pack distribution. In addition, more than 12,000 farmers accessed seeds of the improved varieties through the local seed exchange. Overall, more than 19,000 ha of land were covered through the on-farm demonstrations and promotion of early maturing sorghum varieties adapted to drought stress environments and preferred by growers with the potential of expanding to other small holder farmers. The Melkam variety was taken up by the formal seed system due to its high demand and will be more accessible and available to farmers.

4. Mechanization in the sorghum chain: Sorghum threshing is a most challenging job for farmers and is especially arduous for women and children. Different threshers were tested for the first time for threshing efficiency and quality of service. Based on the

feedback from farmers, redesigning and fabrication of three threshers was conducted. Demonstration of the threshers was undertaken in the project target areas to create demand and establish a system to make them accessible to users. Three different types of mechanical threshers used for other crops were evaluated on farmers' fields for threshing efficiency and convenience to farmers. Modification was made on the selected thresher which increased efficiency from 1.15 to 1.63 tonnes per hectare per hour. Women made up 27% of the farmers testing and using the threshers in this period. Two custom hire service providers were formed and provided threshing services to growers in two districts in Oromia region, Gololcha and Fedis. The cost of threshing with on an on-service basis was 800 to 900 birr/ha, which is about 0.6% of the total revenue per hectare of land. The thresher reduced the time required for threshing a hectare of sorghum land to thresh from one day using traditional means to two hours. To ensure more reliable supply and maintenance service, workshop technicians were trained for local fabrication of the thresher. Three sorghum threshers were manufactured by the trainees and have since been handed over to the Fedis research center in Oromia, and Sirinka Research center in Amhara. With access to these technologies, besides reducing the loss of grain during manual threshing, farmers had time to do additional farm activities and the burden placed on women on-farm reduced and children were able to access education.

5. Reducing post-harvest loss and maintaining quality of sorghum: Post harvest management of sorghum is a challenge for smallholder farmers as they do not benefit as much from their harvest. Because they lack proper post-harvest storage infrastructure, they are forced to sell their grain immediately after harvesting when grain price is low (i.e with the range of 17 to 20 birr/kg). In the past four years, the project conducted demonstration and training on how to use the PICS bags and metal silos were conducted for over 4,000 farmers (48% of them women), development agents and experts. PICS bags were distributed to 5500 and 8 metal silos were distributed to 2781 sorghum farmers. As the quality of seed was maintained by keeping the seed in the PICS bags, farmers were able to sell their grain within the range of 29 to 34 birr/kg after six months of storage with an average profit of 1,179 birr/100 kg. In addition to the benefit of higher quality sorghum, farmers are now using the additional income to purchase farm inputs, food items and access other social services.

3. If appropriate, explain why outputs were not completed or were of poor quality.
Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

The Ethiopia team operated under multiple shocks – Covid-19, floods, instability – in the research regions of Tigray and Amhara. University of Queensland also suffered from floods and the set up for testing the varieties was flooded out that delayed the project. The outputs were therefore delayed as the project sought to catch up on the tests and to organise the farmers at the same time to get the on-farm demonstrations going. The PhD student who was to undertake his research at UQ could also not do this and had to seek the alternative in a university in Ethiopia and therefore had significant delays also. Despite these challenges, the project team pivoted and found alternatives to the enable the project to proceed but some of the outputs will be completed after the project and we hope to receive these once complete from the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research (EIAR).

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?
Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

Climate change is posing a challenge even to the hardiest of crops like sorghum. Coupled with low accessibility of improved sorghum production technologies, poor value chain development, food insecurity will increase as the population increases in Ethiopia. It was therefore critical to address the gaps in the sorghum value chain that would provide access for improved technologies to raise productivity, as well as develop linkages along the value chain actors. The project aimed to enhance the use of improved climate-resilient sorghum production technologies to overcome the risk of drought stress, reduce post-harvest loss through use of improved technologies, reduce drudgery, enhance sorghum utilization and create market linkage for surplus produce.

**Better production:** By combining good agronomic practices, early maturing varieties of sorghum and those that can withstand longer drought, productivity was raised by 44%. The varieties had a combination of traits, and the preference was determined by how farmers use the sorghum. The Melkam variety had wider acceptability than the Argity because of early flowering while Argity was better in both grain yield and biomass production in areas with extended rainfall. Over 8,000 farmers, 16% were women households owning farmland. Farmers directly accessed the improved varieties through LSD and small seed pack distribution. More than 12,000 farmers accessed seeds of the improved varieties through the local seed exchange. Overall, more than 19,000 ha of land were covered through the on-farm demonstrations.

**Reduced drudgery and post-harvest loss:** To reduce drudgery and post-harvest loss, the project trained farmers on use of mechanised equipment for threshing and dehulling sorghum and use of better storage to maintain quality and extend the shelf life of sorghum that can be sold for up to six months. 6 workshop artisans were trained on the fabrication of threshers that reduce the time needed to thresh one hectare from one day to two hours. This freed up time for other productive engagements and on-farm activities. With the quality of sorghum maintained through better post-harvest management, farmers were able to sell their grain for a better price. Previously, a kilo of sorghum fetched 17-20 birr/kg but with the intervention, they realised 29 to 34 birr/kg after six months of storage earning an average profit of 1,179 birr/100 kg. In addition to the quality benefit of keeping the grain in the PICs bags, farmers are using the additional income to purchase farm inputs, food items and access other services.

Developing the market: More than 72% of sorghum grain produced is consumed locally. To develop the value chain and open up the market with increased production, the project triggered the injera value chain in the towns and the rural community with improved injera making techniques and poultry feed as a pulling factor for farmers to use improved technologies and increase productivity. A formulation of 50:50 de-hulled sorghum grain mixed with teff was found to produce the best quality injera. The project supported establishment of women groups in the injera value chain and training was provided using the optimized injera making protocol. A pilot study was conducted through providing dehulled sorghum grain to selected business groups. The reduced cost for injera and consumer acceptance encouraged them to use the dehulled sorghum grain in their business. However, accessibility of the dehulling machine and linkage with the sorghum producers needs further work for wider impact.

5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

There were no unintended consequences, but rather delays emanating from the COVID pandemic restricting movement, and extreme weather events both in Ethiopia and Australia that had floods in the study sites which washed off the lysimeters or structures set up to test for RA and TE. of different varieties. This made it difficult for this project to operate and where contingency plans were put in place, the multiple shocks suffered by this project overwhelmed some of the activities rendering it impossible to operate in some areas. The extent of the impact of the interventions put in place by the project could therefore not be well assessed given the interruptions and inability to operate as the scope had to shift significantly. Nonetheless, the results and analytics of the project from both Ethiopia and Australia have been done but could have been much greater had the situation not unfolded the way it did.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.

Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

1. Invest in knowledge and innovation for large-scale positive change: The sorghum value chain in Ethiopia is not very well developed. The challenge becomes greater with a rising population that needs better productivity to feed but better productivity would lead to significant food loss if there is no market in which to trade the surplus after 70% of the grain is consumed at household level. However, productivity is constrained by extreme climatic events such as drought that is becoming more frequent and more severe, technologies to thresh and dehull sorghum, and the lack of market for sorghum. This project took a whole value chain approach for sorghum from production to consumption ensuring the right seeds were produced, farmers accessed advisory services by way of agronomic practices, threshing and dehulling machinery were fabricated for use by farmers, and that the market would be receptive to formulations of staple foods with sorghum. Developing that chain would enhance food security, making farmers resilient to climate extremes and enabling access to better incomes for better livelihoods among smallholder farmers in Ethiopia.

2. Build leaders of today and tomorrow: To support the project in achieving its objectives, it engaged 3 students to carry out the research mainly on the Root architecture traits and the Transpiration Efficiency of different sorghum varieties. The project incorporated 3 students: 2 MSc students, 1 female and one male and one male PhD student. They all submitted their theses for graduation.

## FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

This was a difficult project administratively and requiring a great number of hours from the GAD team to access the appropriate documentation and proper financial management. Perhaps a progressive meeting with the GAO including a face-to-face meeting at the grantee's site would have eased some of the difficulties encountered as the reviews went beyond 3-5 months and the disbursements were also always late given the inordinate amount of time required to review and approve the financial reports. Perhaps with some of these difficult projects the GAOs could visit the institutions whether at the first 6 months report or 12

months and meet the accounting team and the project PIs to ensure teams understand how to report and what documentation to include.

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

Climate was highlighted as one of the risks that this project could face but the risk was on drought. Floods were not a consideration at the point so the flooding that washed off the infrastructure set up in both EIAR and UQ was not anticipated, and this led to delays in the project. The risk assessment was silent on political insecurity, and this became the biggest risk, aside from the COVID pandemic to the project. Both Tigray and Amhara regions became impossible to operate leaving Oromia as the only functioning region for well over a year. The mitigation measures in the approval document however pointed to the need to have multiple regions for this project and with three regions, the project could carry on while waiting to see how the other two regions turn out. In the end, Oromia and Amhara, that returned to some form of normalcy, remained the main study sites and Tigray was discounted from the project as it was impossible to operate. It was also important to safeguard the team from the risks of political instability and the COVID pandemic and to ensure that they were not protected from these risks until the situations stabilised enough for them to engage with the project teams in the most affected regions. Going forward, it may be important to consider, for Ethiopia, the possibility of multiple shocks and as a contingency right off, to have projects follow a certain spread of regions so should one fall into political instability or flooding, there would be an optional region that could carry the project forward.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

No issues arose on research ethics in this project.
