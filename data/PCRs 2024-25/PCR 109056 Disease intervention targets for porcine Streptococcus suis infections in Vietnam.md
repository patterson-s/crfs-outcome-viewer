## Project Abstract

Streptococcus suis causes high morbidity and mortality in the pig industry, affecting economics, animal welfare and food security within both commercial and small-scale farming. Additionally, S. suis is the leading cause of human meningitis in Vietnam. There are no commercial vaccines available for this disease, and control of infections in pigs relies heavily on the use of antibiotics with antimicrobial resistance (AMR) increasing in prevalence. One of the major barriers to vaccine commercialization is the lack of protection of experimental vaccines against more than one serotype. Specific strategies to ensure prudent use of antimicrobials in swine do not currently exist and the development of effective vaccination strategies as part of improved management of pigs will greatly reduce the impact and spread of S. suis, decrease the volume of antibiotics used for infection and prophylactic treatment, and reduce associated human infection risks.

This proposal focused on the identification of genes that encode factors essential for the pathogenesis of S. suis in pigs from strains currently circulating in Vietnam and assessment of their suitability as vaccine candidates in a passive immunization model using pregnant sows. The research aimed at identifying virulence factors produced by S. suis to evade immune response using a combination of random bacterial mutagenesis and high throughput sequencing. The vaccine strategy was to induce immune response to these factors in sows, who could transfer maternal antibodies via colostrum (first milk consumed by newborns) to protect piglets from infection. The weaned period is the most critical and stressful phase for piglets and often coincides with increased S. suis related mortality. The development of such a product will offset the economic impact of this disease and reduce the requirement for antimicrobials (thus reducing pressure on the development of resistance) and reduce the risk of zoonotic transmission of the infection during food production.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC·CRDI

- Whole genome sequence data, serotype, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and AMR data from 45 strains of *Streptococcus suis* isolated from Vietnam. This was important for the characterization of the isolated strains. Knowing this is important to monitor the pathogen around the world, but particularly in affected areas, and to design proper programs and vaccines to control the disease.
- Detailed phenotypic data of genes and proteins essential for growth of *S. suis* in conditions relating to disease. This was done with the objective of identifying virulence factors that help *S. suis* evade the immune responses and cause disease in pigs. This was fundamental for the design of the vaccine and further understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease.
- Mapped sequence data for 10,000 individual mutant library bank of strains to rapidly identify individual mutants of interest providing a unique resource. This is important for future collaboration with other scientists to pursue virulence and functional studies of individual genes/proteins. This will allow a better understanding of the pathogen and the disease they cause as well as will help on the development of therapeutics and prophylactics, including vaccines and other alternatives.
- Determination and synthesis of protein constructs for 11 *S. suis* proteins, of which purified protein from 3 surface associated proteins were used in sow challenge experiments. These were used as vaccine candidates with two different adjuvants.
- Development of Pragmatic Insertional Mutation Mapping System (PIMMS) web interface bioinformatic analysis tools. This system in addition to be helpful for the team in further understanding the pathogen, in the development of the vaccine, and as diagnostic tool, could also be used by any scientist in the world working with *S. suis* or similar pathogens.

## RESEARCH OUTPUTS

2. List up to 10 most important research outputs generated by the project. Where possible, provide the link.

Outputs are the directly achievable products of a project's completed activities (e.g. policy briefs, journal articles, research papers, trained people, etc.). Indicate the project outputs that were published on an open access basis. What, if any, outputs resulting from this project will be published open access beyond the duration of the project, and it is possible that the grantee will seek further IDRC support for this?

Whole genome sequence data, serotype, and AMR data from 45 strains of *Streptococcus suis* isolated from Vietnam, 34 from Northern Vietnam, where no previous sequence information for strains had been available. This allows to understand the evolution of the pathogen and determine the most prominent strains.

Mapped sequence data for 10,000 individual mutant library-bank of strains to rapidly identify individual mutants of interest providing a unique resource for future collaborative, virulence and functional studies of individual genes/proteins.

Identification of genes that were essential for the pathogenesis of *Streptococcus suis* (*S. suis*) in pigs. This is important not only to understand better the pathogen, but also to design prophylactics, such as vaccines and therapeutics.

Identification of 11 candidate antigens for further analysis, three of which were further developed as candidates for the vaccine.

Development of a web platform (https://pimms-dashboard-uon.azurewebsites.net/) with an easy-to-use interface that can provide rapid output analysis of sequence data, metrics of individual genes with graphical comparisons, mapped sequence regions where genes can be mutated to compare with regions where they cannot be mutated and are considered essential.

Development of assays and protocols that were used for the research. In order to get consistent results, it was important to standardize the assays and write the protocols. Training on these protocols was provided to make sure results were consistent.

Some manuscripts were prepared and are still on the process of being submitted.

3. If appropriate, explain why outputs were not completed or were of poor quality.
Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

The project team completed all their milestones despite two major problems, the Covid-19 pandemic and the outbreak of African Swine Fever in Vietnam in early 2019 and continuing into 2023. This significantly impacted the price and availability of pregnant sows which were required for the challenge experiments and delayed starting trials. It also led to delays in accessing sequencing facilities and obtaining and undertaking subsequent data analysis, isolating *S. suis* strains in Vietnam and shipping them to the UK. There was increased biosecurity on local Vietnamese farms which hampered the collection of *S. suis* strains. The project was extended but the African Swine Fever made it difficult to conduct the studies in pigs. Once the scientists were able to do the challenge experiments, they made a mistake on the preparation of the candidate antigens by not including an adjuvant. Adjuvant is necessary for these types of vaccines to stimulate immune response. After these experiments, the team was able to correct and administer the candidate antigens with an adjuvant. They also had trouble with the challenge model, since it did not induce disease in the control group. This was fixed by changing the strain to a virulent one.

The Recipient designed more experiments on animal trials following the Excelvet Team suggestion in order to get more evidence for the vaccine. Excelvet consultants were hired to evaluate vaccines from LVIF and InnoVet-AMR. They provided feedback to the team, helping them to adjust their clinical trial. They designed 2 more groups with 2 different adjuvants. In the beginning, they planned to test and monitor sows in the 7 weeks before farrowing. They needed to test, monitor, and take care of them before getting pregnant to ensure conditions of experiments were adequate. In addition, finding sows for experiments was more difficult than expected, therefore they tested more sows than anticipated to select those that met experimental requirements. They also checked safety on mice for all proteins before testing them on sows. Animal trials were therefore conducted from May 2022 to July 2023. However, it took more time and personnel, including consultants, technicians, casual labourers. These changes increased the cost for the *in vivo* experiments. Adjustment to the budgets were made with IDRC's approval.

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?
Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

Antimicrobial Resistance, at a global level, is a major threat to human and animal health. Antimicrobials play a critical role in treating mostly bacterial farm animal diseases. However, the high production farm systems and the non-prudent use of antimicrobials, in both human and veterinary medicine, are associated with the emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant micro-organisms (e.g. bacteria) and has been identified as a risk factor for human infectious diseases. Alternative products to antimicrobials, such as the proposed vaccine, can play a crucial role in reducing the need, and hence non-prudent use, of antimicrobials in animal agriculture (e.g. preventing infectious diseases altogether). *Streptococcus suis* serotype 2 is one of the most important causes of bacterial infection and death in post-weaned piglets. These infections cause important economic losses to the swine industry and raise concerns about animal welfare. There is currently no commercial vaccine available for *S. suis*. This organism is also an emerging zoonotic pathogen (transmitted from pigs to humans) that causes adult meningitis in Vietnam. Therefore, it was of extreme importance to fund this project with the hope of finding a solution.

One of the key findings of this project was the identification of virulent factors and candidate antigens. With this knowledge, recombinant proteins were synthesized and tested in mice and pigs. This allowed the team to determine toxicity and efficacy. Part of measuring efficacy was to assess the immune response in blood and colostrum. The latter is important since it is one way that piglets get passive immunity.

The team increased the number of strains in their library. With this, they also increased the mutant bank and sequence library. This is important for future studies, which allow monitoring the pathogen and its evolution. This can also help on the design of prophylactics, such as vaccines, and therapeutics.

From genomic analysis, a total of 20 AMR genes for 11 antibiotic classes were identified, the most prevalent of which were tetO (tetracycline), ermB (macrolide such as erythromycin) and ant(6)-Ia (streptomycin). This shows that resistance to antimicrobials is present in S. suis and there is a need to continue finding alternatives.

The team has generated a wealth of data and resources through this project that scientists will be utilizing for future funding applications, to reassess the potential of vaccine candidates in challenge trials. This research contributed to several areas including molecular genetics, pathology, bioinformatics, immunology, vaccinology, and microbiology.

# 5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

The outputs above were of high quality and are commensurate with the purpose and risk level of the first phase of the project. This project generated important information that contributed to scientific knowledge in the areas of bacteriology and immunology, as well as molecular genetics and vaccinology. The knowledge acquired was presented in several conferences that reached students, PIs, and investors from the scientific community. Contribution of this research helps advance knowledge on S. suis and vaccine development. Some of the findings were not published due to intellectual property sensitivity.

In general, the project evolved as planned. The African swine fever outbreak in pigs changed the progress of the project. But in the end, the team was able to conduct the in vivo experiments. An increase in biosecurity on local Vietnamese farms hampered the collection of S. suis strains, and the team had to use other sources to save time and achieve their goals.

The team encountered a lot of problems with poor quality internet coverage in Vietnam which meant that communication during the project meetings was difficult and made it impossible to deliver any bioinformatics related training remotely.

Except for delays in some milestones that were adjusted to compensate for time, there were no impacts at the end on the delivery of the project. The team managed to adapt to the circumstances and was able to achieve their milestones.

One in vivo experiment was not designed properly since the selected antigens were injected to the pigs without an adjuvant. This designed was the result of the difficulty to obtain commercial adjuvants during and right after the COVID-19 pandemic. Adjuvants are necessary to stimulate immune response to the recombinant proteins that were used. The team was advised to use adjuvants to obtain proper immune responses. They were able to purchase the adjuvants and designed new experiments. With this, the team corrected the course of the project by formulating properly the vaccine candidate.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC’s strategic objectives?
Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.
Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy.
Provide specific numbers where possible.

This project sought to test a technology to develop a vaccine that protects against S. suis in piglets. It offers a promising alternative to reduce the use of antimicrobials in pig farms. The new vaccine technology has the potential to increase animal health and reduce the need for antimicrobials. This was a discovery project and therefore, it was not expected to have a finalized product at the end of the program. The expectation was to achieve a proof-of-concept study and the team met this goal.

This project tackled an important gap: lack of innovative technological solutions to address some of IDRC’s Development Outcomes. Thus, the project laid the foundation upon which subsequent work will be built to ultimately contribute to IDRC’s Development Outcomes, especially “improving health for all”. In general, vaccines contribute to the “enhancing food and nutrition security” development outcome by reducing animal losses from disease and contributing to a sustainable animal health system for the future. The reduction in AM use also contributes to the increase food safety. Healthy animals are also more likely to adapt to climate change. Vaccines are an important tool to improve animal health, which has a positive impact in production, and to reduce the use of antimicrobials.

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

There were few problems identified during the granting process. The team had to wait for their research agreement until the government from Vietnam granted them country clearance. This delayed receiving funds from IDRC. However, once country clearance was obtained, all financial processes went smoothly and without any problems. The teams responded quickly to all IDRC's requests. Any changes required to the budget of the project were requested by the team and approved by IDRC. The financial reports have been finalized.

The recipient from the University of Nottingham completed the work with 95% of the budget expended. The recipient for the National Institute of Veterinary Research, Vietnam, had a moderate deficit in the project due to currency conversion fluctuation (CA$16,000). To adjust this deficit, the recipient reduced their budget in local currency. At the end of the project, this team spent approximately 97.6% of the approved budget.

# STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

One of the identified risks for this project was the country clearance approval from Vietnam. The InnoVet-AMR team established processes that allowed the Vietnamese team to apply for country clearance in a timely manner.

Several risks were identified before the start of the project that were related to the technology. The risks identified with the technology were mitigated by developing a proper research support package that included training on technology, regulatory, intellectual property, quality assurance, marketing / commercialization, and gender. In addition, the InnoVet-AMR team hired various consultants to evaluate the projects in several aspects, including feasibility of the technology to reach market, regulatory, intellectual property, and marketing / commercialization. The consultants provided their findings and advice to the teams. This team was able to correct the clinical experiments to conduct efficacy studies.

There were two big risks that were not identified before the start of the project. One was the COVID-19 pandemic, and the other one was an outbreak of African Swine Fever in Vietnam in early 2019 and continuing into 2023. These two outbreaks had negative impacts on the

execution of the activities of the project. The outbreak of African Swine Fever significantly impacted the price and availability of pregnant sows which were required for the challenge experiments and delayed starting the clinical trials. It also led to delays in accessing sequencing facilities and obtaining and undertaking subsequent data analysis, isolating S. suis strains in Vietnam and shipping them to the UK. There was increased biosecurity on local Vietnamese farms which hampered the collection of S. suis strains. Mitigation strategies, such as extension and supplementation of the project, were developed to overcome these challenges.

The PI from the University of Nottingham mentioned in the technical report that one of the most difficult things to balance was when she was on maternity leave and was unable to travel with a small baby for training and meetings in person with NIVR in Vietnam. She stated that the provision of childcare would have helped her attend in person training and meetings.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

There were no risks that emerged throughout the project or problems/challenges related to ethics. The ethics approvals were received as requested and before the start of the experiments involving animals.

## Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

This project was one of eleven IDRC funded projects which were developed through the Innovative Veterinary Solutions for antimicrobial resistance (InnoVet-AMR), a partnership with the UK Department of Health and Social Care (UK-DHSC). The objective of this initiative was to develop alternatives (including vaccines) to antibiotics in the veterinary sector. This project was 1 of 2 focusing on developing a vaccine against S.suis, a zoonotic disease affecting pigs and humans alike. Now, no vaccine for this disease exists. The focus of the InnoVet-AMR 2.0 was to develop new products and therefore a series of training opportunities was developed by IDRC to accompany the research teams in the product development process toward commercialization. This project was very innovative in testing a technology in piglets. However, results were not that conclusive. Before finalizing the project and the program, a new phase has been negotiated with the UK-DHSC: InnoVet-AMR 2.0. A component of this new program will be to continue funding the projects of InnnoVet-AMR1.0 within a second phase. This project will be able to apply for a phase 2 funding in this new phase of funding

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

As discussed by the PO, this project produced promising results in the development of novel bioinformatic tools and protein constructs that can facilitate the identification and characterization of potential vaccine candidates and diagnostic markers for S. suis, a pathogen of primary concern for animal health and food security, as well as a possible threat for human health. This aligns with the objectives of the Innovet-AMR initiative, which aims to support innovative solutions to reduce the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in livestock and aquaculture in low- and middle-income countries. By advancing the knowledge and technology for preventing and controlling S. suis infections, this project contributes to the global effort to combat AMR and protect human and animal health.

One of the critical lessons from this InnoVet-AMR project is that risk management requires proactive planning, flexibility, and adaptation. The project team had to deal with multiple and unexpected risks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the African Swine Fever outbreak, that affected the implementation and scaling of the technology. To cope with these challenges, the team relied on the support of IDRC, which provided timely country clearance, a comprehensive research support package, and expert consultations on various aspects of technology development and commercialization. IDRC also facilitated the extension and supplementation of the project to allow the team to complete the clinical experiments and efficacy studies. These interventions were crucial for the success of the public-private sector partnership and the potential scaling of the technology to address antimicrobial resistance in Vietnam and beyond.
