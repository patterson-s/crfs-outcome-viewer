| :-- | :-- |
| Adaptation Futures, convened under the auspices of the United <br> Nations, is the world's premier gathering of the climate change <br> adaptation research community. IDRC support and engagement have <br> been critical in broadening the participation of researchers from the <br> Global South. Canada was selected to host the seventh edition of <br> Adaptation Futures to be held in Montreal in 2023, a key year that also <br> saw the beginning of a new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate <br> Change assessment cycle and the first global stock-taking under the <br> Paris Agreement. As the world began to overcome the COVID-19 <br> pandemic, this project sought to redesign Adaptation Futures to enable <br> more meaningful engagement from the Global South, to better <br> replicate the capacity-strengthening and professional-networking <br> benefits of in-person gatherings, and to reduce the carbon footprint of <br> such gatherings. Combining features of virtual and distributed formats <br> were explored for enabling more equitable participation. |  |

# Project Highlights 

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

The project combined support for original research led from McGill University, as well as a contribution to the conference costs coordinated by Ouranos, Quebec's regional climate network.

- Successfully convening of Adaptation Futures in Montreal in October 2023, the first in-person session following the Covid-19 pance. person participants and 460 virtual participants from 127 different countries. Program including 185 scientific sessions: 3 plenaries, 110 sessions, 55 sessions with hybrid format, 11 sessions from the side event 'Innovation Days' and 'Living Lab' (also hybrid)

--- Page 1 ---

and 5 side events. Participation of several Canadian federal ministers, as well as provincial and municipal elected officials. A total of 207 travel grants were awarded, allowing representatives from the global South as well as Canadian Indigenous People to contribute in a very significant way. IDRC officials (Georgina and Bruce) contributed to the scientific and steering committees.

- Original research and piloting to enhance accessibility, inclusivity and equity within such a scientific gathering. Strategic partnerships increased Indigenous engagement, while travel and connectivity grants, along with visa support, promoted equity for delegates from low- and middle-income economies. Early-career researchers benefited from a mentoring program. Additionally, the project reduced the environmental impact of conferencing by creating Regional Pavilions and providing hybrid support, enabling active engagement from underrepresented regions and addressing sustainability concerns.
- Strategic positioning of IDRC as a leader within the climate adaptation: informed global discourse on climate change by amplifying the findings of our Southern partners on local, national, and regional climate solutions; strengthened IDRC visibility as part of Canada's international efforts on climate change; and demonstrated IDRC as a partner of choice with communications on multiple partnerships and exploring new work on environmental defenders and indigenous people. Early support from IDRC helped to enable greater participation from the global South and leverage additional funding from three levels of government (ultimately IDRC funding was equivalent to $\sim 7 \%$ of the overall budget for the conference). More details and photos are in the trip report describing IDRC contributions to the scientific programme.

# PROJECT OUTCOMES 

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

The project underscored the less tangible benefits for career networking and mentoring that do not carry over easily when scientific gatherings pivot format from traditional in-person to virtual online. The original research conducted under this project provides a nuanced assessment of the multiple objectives of conferencing, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of different formats.
![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

In the end, Adaptation Futures was a small step forward (rather than a radical leap). The result was more modest than the original aspiration to rethink and pilot a new way to organize scientific gatherings. Following the Covid pandemic, there are desires to reduce carbon emissions and improve equity in terms of who participates and benefits. The initial plan was to organize a multi-

--- Page 3 ---

hub conference, with participants grouped in different physical locations connected virtually with the central hub (Montreal). Late in 2022, the format pivoted to become predominantly in-person with **limited availability for hybrid** sessions. This change in format was due to the expenses and logistics involved. In the end, the conference included "Regional Pavilions" with one hybrid room dedicated to Latin America and the Caribbean by Fundación Avina, and another dedicated to Africa by the African Academy of Science. The change in format also placed greater importance on travel grants to enable participants from global South to attend, which required intense efforts to support those participants in securing entry visas to Canada.

Below is a summary of the organizers' own assessment of results along with lessons learned, which have been shared with the team which will host the next edition in 2025.

1. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives? Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy.

The project contributed to the strategic objective of "**Share knowledge for greater uptake and use**". Beyond the numbers of sessions and participants reported under *results* (Q1), the trip report describes key insights from IDRC hosted sessions, including: alliances for climate justice with Indigenous peoples, gender lens on climate investment, effective knowledge brokering,

--- Page 4 ---

action-orientated research, women \& youth leadership in climate action, and resilience of food systems.

Of particular note is the session "Rise-up: Partnering for social change" hosted by Georgina. Building on a keynote from CBC's Laura Lynch, this was a powerful discussion that explored the aspiration for equitable partnerships: Who needs to partner with whom? How and when is power shared (and when is it not)? When do partnerships work and when do they fail? How can each of us do better, and be better, as partners for climate action? Panelists included a Canadian indigenous researcher, a Jamaican feminist activist, a community art activist researcher from South Africa, and Canada's minister for the environment and climate change.

## FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

The key point is to plan ahead. IDRC interest in this opportunity can be traced to 2019 conversations with Ouranos once the organization had been selected to host the future

conference. In collaboration with IDRC management and colleagues, this project demonstrated a multi-year approach to knowledge sharing.

# STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS 

## 9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

Yes. The research performed under this project was produced within time and useful to that helped prepare for Adaptation Futures and serve as a reference point for scientific networking. The project also leveraged parallel funding from Mitacs and three levels of government. Although not anticipated as a risk mitigation measure per se, the time of IDRC officials on the scientific and steering committees helped to achieve the results. New IT offerings widen the set of options available for conferencing, yet the insights generated remain useful to event organizers and research funders as we grapple with how to balance equity, sustainable and impact. The world may have largely returned to pre-pandemic openness and travel (a risk identified in the PAD), yet there is continued need for more inclusive and less carbon intensive ways of organizing scientific communities. These messages are eloquently conveyed in the attached comment prepared by Cundill et al and published in Nature Climate Change.

## 10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project?

Not applicable

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

This project exemplifies the strategic alliances that are crucial for the IDRC in advancing our objectives on a global scale. The collaboration with Ouranos and various international partners for Adaptation Futures has underscored our commitment to resilience and adaptation and positioned the IDRC as a central player in the discourse around climate change adaptation. By fostering these alliances, we have amplified the voices and solutions from the global South, ensuring that local, national, and regional insights inform global strategies. This aligns with our 2030 vision to support climate resilience and equitable development.

Supporting Adaptation Futures has showcased the IDRC's leadership in climate adaptation research, particularly before a Canadian audience. By hosting key sessions and supporting diverse participation, we have demonstrated our capacity to convene and lead critical discussions on climate action. This initiative has highlighted how strategic funding and support can enable more inclusive dialogues, bringing together many stakeholders to forge common paths forward.

Several lessons can be drawn from this project to guide similar future events. First, early and strategic planning, including securing partnerships and funding, is paramount. Second, ensuring accessibility and inclusivity through travel grants and hybrid formats can significantly enhance participation and equity. Lastly, the importance of flexible and adaptive planning cannot be overstated, as seen in the pivot to a predominantly in-person format to address logistical challenges. These insights will be invaluable for future initiatives to foster resilience and adaptation in the face of the climate crisis.

I approve this PCR.

*Check for updates*

Adaptation evidence and knowledge are diverse and unequally represented in global adaptation discourse. The Adaptation Futures 2023 conference sought to bring this diversity together to advance more inclusive and impactful adaptation science, and confronted both the benefits and the trade-offs that this effort entails.

Adaptation Futures is the flagship event of the World Adaptation Science Programme, and since its inception in 2010 it has offered a dedicated space for adaptation researchers to discuss progress and set new avenues for adaptation science and implementation. As the largest conference series dedicated to climate change adaptation, the Adaptation Futures 2023 conference attracted over 2,000 participants from 127 countries, with 180 sessions in the core agenda and 15 side events. The conference received glowing reviews for the range of under-represented perspectives it showcased and the diverse forms of exchange it featured.

Successive host organizations of Adaptation Futures have increasingly made efforts to engage a wider diversity of knowledge holders in the conference, including practitioners, policymakers, funders, and local and Indigenous communities. This trend has come, in part, from a groundswell of recognition that locally led adaptation needs to be guided by those directly affected by climate change, and they, first and foremost, have a right to make adaptation decisions about their own futures. This shift reached its fullest expression so far in Montreal in 2023, where the conference was locally hosted by Ouranos, an organization specializing in regional scale climatology and adaptation to climate change. Both the steering and science committees were purposefully selected for their breadth and diversity of knowledge, expertise and ability to bridge science, policy, Indigenous knowledges and practice. Also, their selection was based on the geographic diversity of their experience and expertise. Of particular concern was ensuring robust representation from the Global South.

Advancing work on equity and diversity in conferencing spaces requires making concrete changes that disrupt established norms of practice. Here we describe some of the steps that were taken, and the challenges and trade-offs encountered.

## Shaking up the format

Academic and professional conferences have long been dominated by one-directional formats of 'knowledge transfer', such as slideshow presentations by individuals, punctuated by brief and highly structured opportunities for dialogue. These formats have been shown to privilege particular kinds of speakers and forms of knowledge over others.

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

In an era of information overload, their value in comparison to more dialogical, co-produced and even embodied forms of interaction has come into question.

Recognizing that expanding the ways we explore adaptation in conferences can broaden participation, foster new perspectives on the complexity of adaptation challenges and practices, and create pathways to co-create knowledge, the conference purposefully offered a range of session formats. The call document encouraged the submission of a more diverse range of session formats, including creative and co-creation sessions. The conference also set a target ratio of each session format, with traditional panels not exceeding 30% of all sessions. Session hosts were offered a virtual consultation ahead of the conference to enable them to prepare for the more creative session formats, and specific rooms in the conference venue were dedicated to creative sessions by equipping them accordingly (for example, with IT resources, flipcharts, movable tables and so on). Mentoring sessions were also held with early career researchers and those new to Adaptation Futures.

## Beyond making space for under-represented groups

Allocating spaces for groups that have historically been under-represented in international academic conferences, such as researchers from the Global South, early career researchers and Indigenous people, is not enough. Even if seats are left open for these groups, the systemic barriers that have prevented them from participating in the past will remain. It is essential for conferences to adapt their abstract review process, respond to funding needs, assist participants in navigating visa and immigration hurdles, offer facilitated hybrid sessions for those unable to attend in person and offer capacity support for participants on site. At Adaptation Futures, 227 travel grants were awarded in total. Of these, 100 were given to participants from the Global South, most of whom were early career professionals, and 120 travel grants were given to Canadian Indigenous people.

Latin American and African pavilions were created to ensure dedicated space on the agenda and representation of the adaptation priorities for those regions. These efforts made a difference: 80-90\% of session submissions from Latin America and the Caribbean and from sub-Saharan Africa were accepted, compared with an acceptance rate of $50-60 \%$ of session submissions led by individuals based at institutions in North America and Europe.

Indigenous people played a vital role in this Adaptation Futures conference. Indigenous representatives were engaged in the conference planning process as members of both the science and the steering committees. Also, the conference host established a partnership with an Indigenous-led environmental organization to provide guidance on appropriate protocols and invite speakers. Moreover, Indigenous perspectives and knowledge were actively advocated for throughout the conference planning. For example, there was a dedicated call for abstracts specifically aimed at Indigenous groups, and dedicated sessions set aside exclusively for Indigenous groups to share their knowledge, together with regular sessions featuring contributions from Indigenous people. The final ceremony to transfer the leadership of the conference to New Zealand also included Indigenous leaders from that country, signalling the engagement of Indigenous leadership in the conference in the future. This was key: continuing to offer a welcoming space for Indigenous knowledges will allow the number of applicants, funding and collaborations to grow into the future.

## Challenges and trade-offs

Despite this equity-seeking approach, achieving a balanced representation of individual researchers from around the world, along with their knowledge and insights, was not fully realized. In the end, $70 \%$ of all conference participants came from North America and Europe, with participation from the Global South remaining a minority. This may be a product of the location of the conference, which took place in Canada, where the travel costs and visa requirements, including extended waiting times on occasion, may have deterred some participants from the Global South. The impact of 'passport privilege' on participation in global science engagements has been well documented in recent years ${ }^{4}$.

Creating space for new actors means giving up space by others, thereby resulting in both winners and losers, and requiring trade-offs. For example, capping the space for traditional paper sessions meant that some compelling submissions could not be accepted. For some, the result of equity-seeking approaches was exciting, even transformative, and heralded a more inclusive and impactful kind of adaptation science. The under-represented groups felt, for the first time in some instances, that they could contribute to adaptation research on a global stage. For others, it implied that they had lost one of the few remaining spaces dedicated to adaptation science. The conference received formal complaints from scholars who felt sidelined due to what they perceived as a flawed selection process for abstracts. Some participants also felt that there was a lack of finalized research results presented and too many tentative and emergent dialogues.

Furthermore, all of the equity-seeking interventions mentioned above were costly. The entire event depended on substantial fundraising by the host organization. On a finite budget, choices needed to be made between, for example, funding travel grants versus purposeful geographic coverage via the pavilions for Africa and Latin America. These pavilions required dedicated organizational leadership and translation equipment. At many points, choices needed to be made, for example, between representation of different regions and stakeholders.

Every decision came with trade-offs for some groups. The inevitable trade-offs described here are necessary to reduce the inequalities in access to global scientific discourses.

## Future of adaptation scholarship

Expanding the depth and breadth of knowledge available to adapt to climate change can only be achieved by creating more inclusive spaces. On the one hand, the purpose of these inclusive spaces is to grow our ability to imagine and enact new plausible futures, solutions and collaborations. Participants from Adaptation Futures 2023 reported new collaborations emerging from the conference on such diverse topics as adaptation resistance, knowledge co-production, queering theory and disability, early career trajectories and education, demonstrating the value of broadening the adaptation knowledge base through inclusive approaches. On the other hand, inclusive spaces are necessary for epistemic justice. Holders of local and Indigenous knowledges have historically been excluded from adaptation research, despite being disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change ${ }^{5}$.

The efforts made at Adaptation Futures 2023 to diminish the substantial disparity in adaptation evidence and knowledge represent an important step forward, but they were just a small step. Expanding access to conferences, funding and opportunities to publish, and to mentorship for under-represented groups, is a long-term enterprise that all adaptation scholars must engage in going forward. Indeed, addressing this injustice in the future requires concerted efforts, not only for adaptation conferences, but indeed for all aspects of adaptation work. Journal editors, grant makers, student supervisors and intergovernmental bodies (such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the World Meteorological Organization) should be applauded for their equity-seeking work and encouraged to do more.

The 2023 Adaptation Futures experience has demonstrated that there are inevitable winners and losers involved in the various trade-offs that come with efforts to seek equity and inclusion in adaptation science. Expanding the range of voices, knowledge and expertise within finite spaces like scientific conferences inevitably means that some groups will have to cede ground to newcomers. Doing so, however, creates new opportunities for collaboration that can drive adaptation research forward. Therefore, we consider these trade-offs worthwhile, and look forward to the outcomes and continued broadening of the adaptation community.
