#### Abstract

Project Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic is threatening livelihoods and food security of millions of people. Family farming provides a significant share of food supply, and has an important role in the transition toward sustainable agri-food systems and in the fight against a possible food crisis. The sector is facing multiple challenges, and these are exacerbated under the current pandemic. The project will generate evidence and promote changes to agri-food systems in the aftermath of the pandemic. It will contribute to mitigate the impact on the food security and the consumption of the most vulnerable, with particular emphasis on women. It will promote small and medium-scale farming, and promote more sustainable, gender sensitive, and inclusive agri-food systems, that are more resilient to shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The project will be implemented in Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, Ecuador and Chile. It will be led by the organization RIMISP-Latin American Center for Rural Development.


# PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS 

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?
2. Understanding the most important determinant of food security: The project generated empirical evidence on the impacts of different crises of multiple nature, starting with the COVID-19 pandemic, on rural and rural-urban areas, addressing a multiplicity of components and relationships. Territories of the five countries are inherently different, they faced the impacts from the pandemic (health, economic and social), the subsequent inflationary crisis, and the impacts of other crisis (such as two category 4 hurricanes in Guatemala and a public security crisis in Ecuador). The project demonstrated that going through these crises, the most important determinant of food insecurity in the territories is the socioeconomic level of households. The impacts of

--- Page 1 ---

these crises have resulted in a deterioration of economic indicators, increased poverty, unemployment and food insecurity in the territories studied. Despite the fact that the different territories were impacted and responded differently to the factors described, the socioeconomic level and assets of households were the most important variables that determined food insecurity and the types of community response across territories and different types of crises. Public policies aimed at improving household food security and their resilience to shocks should thus focus on the socioeconomic level and assets of households.
2. The project conducted participatory processes of prioritization and generation of public policy proposals based on research evidence, involving actors at different levels active in territorial development. Based on this, different policy incidence strategies were promoted, at the national and local levels, which has resulted in discussion processes with decision-makers to create or reorient public policies with an impact on territorial stakeholders.

- For example, in Colombia, joint work with the Food Security Office of the Government of Nariño promoted a departmental strategy based on agroecology as an element of resilience in agricultural production and focussing on the conservation and use of native seeds. This included implementing a pilot project to protect these seeds, supporting local organizations' initiatives, and integrating the project's findings into the department's medium- and long-term strategy on this issue.
- In Guatemala, evidence generated through the participatory process with peasant and indigenous organizations in Alta Verapaz were positioned in the electoral discussion, including the access to local market, healthy food in public schools, economic and commercialization programs for women, coordination between organizations, ancestral authorities and municipal authorities and protection of water and forest resources.
- In Mexico, the project identified an opportunity for political incidence through a proposal to modify the "Precios de Garantía" program by SEGALMEX. This program, designed to support small and medium-scale producers by purchasing harvests at guaranteed prices, faced challenges in resource distribution and achieving its objectives. The proposal consisted of transferring current beneficiaries of the "Precios de Garantía" program to the "Producción para el Bienestar" program, redistributing the budget assigned to SEGALMEX within the Secretariat of Agriculture and Rural Development (SADER). This change would reduce costs associated with storage, transportation, and preservation, redirecting these resources to strengthen direct support. The proposal, which did not require additional budget allocations or the creation of new programs, aligned with the government's priorities at the time.
- In Ecuador, the project developed a political incidence strategy to strengthen Family Farming in the provinces of Guayas and Los Ríos. This strategy included implementing demonstration plots for sustainable production of maize, rice, and cocoa in collaboration with local actors and promoting agroecological practices through agreements with AGROCALIDAD, the agency responsible for control and regulation in animal health, plant health, and food safety. These actions were carried out through the Rural Dialogue Groups (GDR), multi-

stakeholder platforms legitimized in Ecuadorian public policy, fostering collaboration between public and private sectors.

- In Chile, through the participation of the director of the Rimisp-Chile office in the Presidential Expert Advisory Commission for updating poverty measurement, and based on the findings of the food insecurity study conducted within the framework of the project, the FIES scale of food insecurity experience was incorporated into the health dimension of multidimensional poverty measurement. This incorporation underscores the importance of poverty measurement as a key tool to inform and guide public policy decisions in the country.

The project has multiplied engagements ( 164 on total), including high-level discussions, formal meetings and other events with multiple stakeholders such as other researchers, policymakers, practitioners and community members.
3. The project showed that households used strategies to mitigate the effects of the shocks they have experienced, but this increased their vulnerability to new shocks in the middle or long term. Reducing the nutritional quality of the diet, especially in households with young children, using pension funds early, selling machinery or animals, and reducing spending on education and health, are effective measures in the short term, but may not be sustainable in the long run. This has the effect of reducing their resilience to successive shocks, or the efficiency with which they can do so, as they gradually deplete their physical, human and financial capitals.
4. The project analysed gender differentiated impacts from the COVID pandemic and strategies to face food insecurity during the pandemic. It showed that women headed households had higher poverty rates and had modified more their strategies to obtain food than their male counterparts. They also expressed greater concern about feeding their family. Intersectional reading showed that women headed households received more help from governments and from friends and family, as women would participate to a greater extent to solidarity networks in the local space than men, and this was more exacerbated in rural areas.
5. The scientific production of this project is outstanding in quantity and quality. It has generated three peer reviewed papers (including one not yet published but accepted), 23 conjuncture analyses, 3 policy briefs and 3 working papers. They cover five countries of Latin America, with analysis extending to the entire region, that became one of the most comprehensive set of documentation of the impacts of the COVID-19 in Latin American Food Systems and possible solutions to address recovery. Two peer reviewed papers are in English, which will ensure the main lessons and results will reach audience beyond the Latin American region. The conjuncture analyses publications, have an important outreach in the Latin American region, as part of the comms strategy that made Rimisp's reputation of high-quality research network.

# PROJECT OUTCOMES 

12. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

This project has been one of the main source of documentation of the impact of the COVID 19 on food systems in LAC. For IDRC, it is one of the most comprehensive study used in our landmark Synthesis of IDRC's COVID and Food Systems Initiative. Also is was publicized and used in the LAC region through several medias and forums.

- In a nutshell, the project has shown that food systems and food security were affected by the COVID - 19 pandemic and other shocks that followed (hurricane in Guatemala, territorial conflict in Mexico, Colombia and Chile, and indigenous mobilization in Ecuador). All aspects of the food system were affected, in particular for small holder farmers, the commercialization of their products due to closure of fairs and markets and mobility restrictions. This then affected income and investment capacity. Hiring external labor was also impeded by mobility restriction, which limited production and harvest capacity. Many of them had to seek alternatives solutions: increased their indebtedness, reduced cultivated areas, substituted chemical supplies for organic supplies, and got collectively and socially organized.
- The project showed important impacts on food security, associated with the loss of income sources, reduced employment due to containment measures and lockdown, which summed on structural conditions already affecting the poorest when it comes to economic access to food. It affected negatively their diet, with a decrease in consumption of fresh foods and an increase in processed foods. As mentioned, impact was bigger for women and in rural households. Territorial and country differences were observed pointing to specific territorial conditions determining the differentiated impacts on food insecurity in each territory. Food insecurity was strongly determined by the level of household assets, where poorer households were more likely to experience moderate and severe food insecurity in all countries and territories and female-headed households and those with a greater number of dependent members were more likely to experience moderate and severe food insecurity. Interestingly, exploratory analysis showed that belonging to an indigenous community aggravated the food situation in some territories, while in others it was rather helping. This was not the aim of the study but it suggested that more detailed studies would allow better understand these characteristics and their influence on households' resilience or vulnerability.


# 13. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way? 

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

The project was approved during the COVID-19 pandemic, so the methods took the restrictions into consideration, and little adjustments were needed. One thing that was improved, was in terms of gender. Specific research instruments from the methodology were conceived to exclusively target women, such as life stories and focus groups. During interviews, it became clear that to better understand the heterogeneity of rural realities and the specific contributions of women, it was necessary to broaden the perspective and include men's voices. Therefore, interviews were conducted with both women and men, allowing a more complete and enriching vision of gender dynamics in the rural context.

## 14. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.
Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

The project was part of the CORE -COVID-19 Responses for Equity cohort. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the programing of the center pivoted to address its impacts and solutions for reconstruction. This project fit directly in this line. It had also a strong focus on gender integration, aiming at documenting differentiated impacts the COVID 19 on women as producers, food suppliers, workers in non-agricultural activities and as mothers and promoting strategies for gender empowerment based on these evidence. This was reflected in the policy options promoted and supported, that aimed at promoting women's economic autonomy through empowerment, access to productive assets, and associative capacity in relation to agri-food systems.

# STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS 

## 17. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

The project was developed and approved during the pandemic; the team was prepared to conduct research in the unusual context of the pandemic. They had prepared accordingly and had a clear plan and scenarios with different options to adapt and implement project activities in case the situation would get worse in any country of the project. This strategy proved to be very successful, including when other shocks summed to the COVID impacts.

The risk linked to resurgence of violence or political unrest was also identified as a potential risk in the PAD. The planning of activities in regions where political instability was not expected to be a major concern and close monitoring of the security situation by the research team throughout the project also proved to be a useful strategy. No incident of this type affected the project implementation, even in the case of public security crisis in Ecuador.
18. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

## Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

As pointed out by Sandra, the project from RIMISP has led to impressive results. Not only did it generate robust and extensive results on the impacts of COVID and COVID measures on the food security and vulnerability status of households in multiple countries of Latin America, but it successfully extended its assessment to other types of shocks (subsequent to COVID). The magnitude of engagement with multiple stakeholders and the use of research evidence to inform policy incidence strategy and processes (such as in Colombia and Guatemala) are also very impressive.

Overall, the project demonstrated that RIMISP, which has been a long-term partner of IDRC on territorial development in Latin America, has successfully used its specific expertise and approach to diversify and expand its scope of work. The integration of Gender dynamics as one of the key components of the project also reflects the maturity of the RIMISP network.

Finally, I am particularly pleased to see the three peer review publications as IDRC repeatedly encouraged RIMISP to move beyond its traditional knowledge sharing strategy and to complement its internal publications (such as the 23 conjuncture analysis, policy briefs and working papers) by peer reviewed scientific publications to engage with the scientific community and contribute to global debates.

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

It's impressive to read about this ambitious, yet successfully implemented project across 5 Latin American countries during the COVID pandemic, with all the challenges that would have been faced in conducting the work in challenging circumstances. I hope to learn more about the public policy responses proposed: How they were considered or implemented, whether they remain relevant or current, or may be considered in future if/when other food systems shocks occur.

It was intriguing to note the reference to differing impacts of the COVID shocks to indigenous community food systems, and suggesting that in some cases they were more resilient and less vulnerable. Indeed, such was the case across all communities however it might be valuable to extend knowledge on the protective factors.

Further reading of the outputs would also provide a valuable record and comparative analysis of the situation across the 5 countries.

I am pleased to approve and recommend formal closure of the project.
