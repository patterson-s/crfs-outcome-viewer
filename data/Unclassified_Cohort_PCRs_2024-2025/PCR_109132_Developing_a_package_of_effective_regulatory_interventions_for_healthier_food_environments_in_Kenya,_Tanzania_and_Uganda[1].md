| Project Abstract |
| :-- |
| Low and middle-income countries are experiencing the burden of nutrition-related non- <br> communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, largely driven by increasingly unhealthy <br> food environments. Although there is growing international consensus on the policy actions (in <br> particular fiscal and regulatory policies) needed to create healthy food environments and <br> prevent nutrition-related NCDs, few countries in Africa have the local evidence to motivate <br> action or the capacity to adopt such policy interventions. |
| The overarching goal of this project is to identify context-relevant priority actions that promote <br> healthy food consumption patterns and facilitate knowledge translation pathways to prevent <br> nutrition-related NCDs in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. The project will mainly adapt <br> methodological approaches developed by the International Network for Food and Obesity <br> NCDs Research Monitoring and Action Support (INFORMAS), a global network of public- <br> interest organizations and researchers that monitors, benchmarks, and supports public and <br> private sector actions to increase healthy food environments. More than 35 countries have <br> implemented various INFORMAS approaches, some funded by IDRC. The project will also <br> estimate the economic costs of policy inaction and the political and legal feasibility of potential <br> policy and regulatory interventions for improving food environments. |
| This project will be funded through the Global Regulatory and Fiscal Capacity Building <br> Program, a multi-agency parallel-funding partnership between IDRC, the Swiss Agency for <br> Development and Cooperation, the OPEC Fund for International Development, the <br> International Development Law Organization, and the World Health Organization. |

# PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS 

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

--- Page 1 ---

- This project conducted the first ever implementation of the Healthy Food Environment Policy Index (Food-EPI) tool in Uganda and Tanzania. The Food-EPI tool was developed in 2013 to measure the extent of implementation of healthy food environment policies by governments compared to international best practice. The tool was developed by the International Network for Food and Obesity/Non-communicable Diseases Research, Monitoring and Action Support (INFORMAS). It has been implemented in over a dozen countries across the world. Prior to this grant, the project team had successfully implemented the Food-EPI tool in Kenya. They used this experience to implement the tool in Uganda and Tanzania. In both countries, the Food EPI analysis showed that even though frameworks and guidelines for promoting a healthy food environment were generally available, there were significant gaps in their implementation.
- This project is also the first study in Kenya to document the frequency of marketing of unhealthy food and beverage to children via television, in stores, and around schools. The study also documented the persuasive strategies used in advertisements for unhealthy food and beverages to attract children's attention. Till date, no other study in East Africa has specifically measured the extent to which unhealthy food and beverages are marketed to children via television and at retail outlets. The project found that Kenyan children are exposed to a high level of unhealthy food and beverage marketing.
- The project estimated the economic burden of a selected food-related noncommunicable disease (NCD) by conducting cost-of-illness (COI) analyses in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania. COI studies can enable more effective allocation of healthcare resources by decisionmakers. Following consultations with ministries of health and key stakeholders across the three countries, the project team decided to conduct the COI analyses on diabetes. Diabetes in an important food-related NCD that typically poses a significant financial burden on health systems across the world. When decisionmakers become aware of the actual cost of diabetes, they could become incentivized to invest in policies and strategies for preventing diabetes and NCDs more broadly. The analysis found that diabetes costs the healthcare system between US $\$ 270$ million in Tanzania and $\$ 3.8$ billion in Uganda.
- The project designed a tool to assess the legal and political feasibility of implementing two policies aimed at promoting healthier food environments in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania. These policies are 1) child-directed marketing restriction of unhealthy foods and beverages and 2) simplified nutrition labelling of packaged foods and beverages. This tool was adapted from an existing framework known as FELIP. However, the limitation of the traditional FELIP framework is that it only determines which policies are possible to implement but does not take into consideration the probability of their success. Therefore, the team adapted the tool to address this gap. The adapted version will be made publicly available in an Open Access article so that other researchers can adapt it to their local contexts as needed.
- The visibility from this project has better positioned the project leads to inform and influence policymaking in their respective contexts. The project lead in Kenya, Dr Gershim Asiki, is now leading another IDRC-supported project (109865) that is generating evidence and providing technical support to the Kenya Ministry of Health in the development of healthy food environment policies. The project co-PI, Prof Karen Hofman, was already renowned in South Africa for her contributions to advancing healthy food environment policies. Her previously funded IDRC project (108424) informed the implementation of a tax on sugar sweetened beverages (known as the health promotion levy) in South Africa. She is also now leading another IDRC funded project (109866) that aims to identify potential levers for policy intervention in trade and investment law to improve diets across Sub Saharan Africa.

## Project Outcomes

iii) How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

- Food policies in Uganda and Tanzania have the potential to enable healthier food environments but there are gaps in their development and implementation:
The Food-EPI tool has 55 indicators for food policies such as front of package labelling, taxation of unhealthy food, food fortification, among others. In the first step of applying the Food-EPI tool, the stage of development of each policy is determined in each country. The project found that in Tanzania, out of 55 food policies, 1 policy was in the initiation phase, 13 were in the development phase, 33 were in the implementation phase and 6 were in the evaluation phase. In Uganda, no policies were in the initiation phase, 20 policies were in the development phase, 34 policies were in the implementation phase and 1 policy was in the evaluation phase. So, in general, both countries had majority of their food policies situated at the implementation or development phase.

--- Page 3 ---

In the second step of applying the Food-EPI tool, each of these policies were then rated against international best practices. In Uganda and Tanzania, majority of the policies showed low or little no progress when benchmarked against international best practices. These findings are consistent with similar studies in Kenya and Ghana. Furthermore, among those the policies that were rated well against their benchmark, none of them were directly related to the prevention of NCDs.

In summary, the application of the Food-EPI tool in Uganda and Tanzania showed that there is room for policymakers to do more to ensure that existing food environment policies are better implemented, and to accelerate progress in the development of policies that specifically enable a healthier food environment in both countries.

Kenyan children are exposed to a high level of unhealthy food and beverage marketing via the following channels:

# Advertisements near schools (food outlets and billboards) 

The project found a significant number of food advertisements near schools, with an average of nearly 6 ads per school in urban areas. These advertisements heavily promoted unhealthy, ultra-processed foods, with nearly half (48\%) falling into this category. This percentage was even higher in rural areas. Sugary drinks were the most commonly advertised type of ultra-processed food. Promotional tactics often relied on child-friendly characters, like cartoons or company mascots, to grab children's attention. Most advertisements used a combination of logos, pictures, and text to further influence children's preferences. Overall, these findings suggest a troubling level of exposure to unhealthy food marketing that could potentially influence children's eating habits in Kenya.

## In-store advertisement in retail outlets/supermarkets near schools

In examining the availability and promotion of unhealthy food in stores near schools. The results raise concerns, as over $60 \%$ of the food sold and nearly $40 \%$ advertised were classified as unhealthy, ultra-processed options. While the overall healthiness of food sold didn't vary greatly by store size or location, marketing tactics specifically targeted unhealthy choices. Supermarket size, placement of products within the store (like aisles and edges), and socioeconomic setting all influenced which unhealthy foods were advertised. This suggests a strategic effort to promote unhealthy options to children visiting these stores.

## TV advertisements

Over a quarter of all TV advertisements promote food or drinks, and a staggering $82 \%$ of these advertised options are considered unhealthy "non-core" foods. Even more troubling, these unhealthy food ads are concentrated during peak viewing times ( 5 pm 9 pm ), which coincides with when most Kenyan children watch TV. The study also found that television is the primary source of food advertisement exposure for children, with nationwide channels like Citizen, KTN, and NTV being the most frequently mentioned. These findings suggest that Kenyan children are bombarded with unhealthy food marketing messages during their peak TV viewing hours.

In essence, the findings highlight the need for policymakers in Kenya to develop and implement policies that restrict child-directed marketing of unhealthy food and beverages.

Food related NCDs such as diabetes impose a significant financial burden on healthcare systems:
According to project estimates, the healthcare system in Kenya incurs annual costs of US $\$ 620$ million for managing diabetes, while in Tanzania, the figure is US $\$ 270$ million, and in Uganda, it amounts to US $\$ 3.8$ billion. In Kenya and Uganda, the

--- Page 4 ---

primary contributors to these costs are the treatment of diabetic complications, representing approximately $60 \%$ and $76 \%$ of total expenses, respectively. In Tanzania, medication (particularly oral medications and insulin) is identified as the primary cost driver. The project team observed that Uganda's cost estimate for illness is significantly higher than that of Kenya and Tanzania, primarily due to the use of private sector data, as public sector cost data were unavailable. These findings are preliminary and subject to potential adjustments in the future.

Overall, these findings underscore the importance of prioritizing NCD prevention policies, particularly those aimed at fostering a healthier food environment, to alleviate the considerable financial strain imposed by food-related NCDs on the healthcare system.

- It is legally and politically feasible to implement public policies that promote healthier food environments in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania:
Through the legal feasibility study, the project found that policymakers in Kenya appear to be inclined towards implementing a front-of-pack nutritional labeling (FOPNL) system to promote healthier food environments, considering it feasible through regulatory mechanisms outlined in the Food, Drugs, Chemical and Substances Act. The system would feature interpretive labeling to address consumer literacy issues, focusing on key nutrients such as energy, sodium, saturated fat, and sugar. However, it's recognized that FOPNL alone isn't sufficient; public education, advocacy efforts, and improved labeling verification systems are deemed necessary, along with additional measures like food marketing restrictions.

In Tanzania, stakeholders emphasized alignment with regional standards for labeling mechanisms, proposing a graphic interpretation system with flexibility to identify problematic (unhealthy) products. Enforcement through a central body, accompanied by significant sanctions for non-compliance, is favored. Child-directed marketing restrictions face less clarity but are seen as feasible under existing legal frameworks.

In Uganda, both FOPNL and restrictions on child-directed marketing are considered feasible, with the legal infrastructure in place, although barriers such as industry interference and limited enforcement capacity exist. The Ugandan National Bureau of Standards was identified as the regulator authority that would oversee FOPNL, emphasizing the need for accommodating labels for the less literate population. However, challenges include weak enforcement capacity, lack of informed population, outdated data, and political influences from industry stakeholders.

Invest in knowledge and innovation for large-scale positive change:

--- Page 5 ---

This project generated new knowledge on the extent of implementation of food environment policies in Tanzania and Uganda. The project also generated novel evidence on the extent and nature of marketing of unhealthy food and beverages to children in Kenya. This baseline knowledge is crucial for informing double-duty policy actions for enabling healthier food environments across the three countries. Indeed, in Kenya, the project team is already moving ahead with supporting the Ministry of Health in Kenya to develop and implement up to four of these double-duty policy actions (see project 109865). Stakeholders in Uganda and Tanzania are also showing strong interest in developing such policies in their respective countries.

# Build the leaders for today and tomorrow: 

This project supported the training of several early career researchers including two interns (both women), one research fellow (a woman) and four PhD students (3 women). In addition to this training, the methodological approaches (e.g. the legal feasibility tool) adapted or developed by the project, and the results generated will serve the global and LMIC research community for years to come.

## Be the partner of choice for greater impact:

The project was supported as part IDRC's contributions (parallel funding) to the Global Regulatory and Fiscal Capacity Building Program (Global RECAP), a multi-agency parallel-funding partnership between IDRC, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, the OPEC Fund for International Development, the International Development Law Organization, and the World Health Organization (WHO). The project team ensured that it engaged the program partners throughout the duration of the project. In fact, the project team and WHO have worked quite closely in supporting the Ministry of Health in Kenya to make progress in developing a Nutrient Profiling Model and a FOPNL system. Global RECAP has been renewed for phase 2 and all the countries in phase 1 will continue to be involved. Although IDRC has not made any specific funding commitment to this new phase, the CRFS Program remains engaged with Global RECAP partners and will continue to explore opportunities to support research that aligns with the Program's priorities.
