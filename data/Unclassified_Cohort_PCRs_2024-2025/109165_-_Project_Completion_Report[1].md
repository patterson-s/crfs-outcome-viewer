| Project Abstract |  |
| :-- | :-- |
| South Africa has sub-Saharan Africa's highest levels of obesity, with approximately 70\% of <br> women and 30\% of men in South Africa either overweight or obese. Obesity is a major risk <br> factor for non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, which account for 51\% of all deaths <br> in South Africa. The country's high levels of obesity are attributed to increased consumption of <br> unhealthy, highly processed food. Access to highly processed foods is increasing, especially <br> among the poor, as large food retail companies expand into low-income areas. This project <br> aims to explore the potential of rotating savings and credit associations, known as stokvels, to <br> address the obesity burden in South Africa. |  |
| Approximately 21\% of South Africa's 800,000 registered stokvels are grocery stokvels. These <br> grocery stokvels, comprised mostly of low-income women, typically leverage collective buying <br> power to garner discounts on groceries with a long shelf life from retailers and wholesalers. <br> Most of these items are highly processed or energy dense foods, often of low nutritional <br> quality. This project aims to determine the manner and extent to which grocery stokvels could <br> be leveraged in order to increase demand for and access to affordable, healthy food in South <br> Africa. A key anticipated result is the development of a refined and testable theory of change <br> regarding the potential of stokvels to increase demand for and access to healthy, affordable <br> food. |  |

# PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS 

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?
a) New knowledge:

This project enhanced our understanding of the challenges and opportunities for enabling women-led grocery stokvels to access healthy food. Stokvels are the local term for rotating savings and credit associations in South Africa. The project published two peer-

--- Page 1 ---

reviewed papers detailing the outcomes of a systematic review and a stakeholder mapping exercise, respectively. Additionally, they conducted a realist evaluation and discrete choice experiments (DCE). The realist evaluation aimed to enhance comprehension of individual and collective agency, as well as the factors influencing decision-making regarding food purchasing and food practices within stokvels and among their members. The objective of the DCE was to investigate potential incentives for stokvels to prioritize healthy food choices. DCEs represent a class of econometric models designed to predict preferences of individuals or groups when presented with hypothetical alternatives. Collectively, these studies unequivocally affirmed the significant role stokvels play in ensuring household food security and serving as a safeguard for savings in South Africa. Furthermore, they facilitate knowledge exchange, offer social support, and provide economic empowerment to members. However, the studies revealed that considerations of food quality, nutrition, or health promotion were not prioritized in the operations of stokvels. This identified gap underscores a missed opportunity that warrants further exploration through targeted interventions. For example, the DCE revealed that the establishment of stokvel-owned vegetable gardens could shift members' preference towards healthy food.
b) Gender implications:

From its inception, the project's goals directly addressed women's empowerment, specifically targeting those from economically marginalized backgrounds, who constitute the majority of members in grocery stokvels. Indeed, the project's findings illuminated the significance of women-led stokvels as vital platforms for exercising economic agency and participating in collective decision-making. The research participants, predominantly women, consistently highlighted their active involvement in decisions related to fund allocation and purchase selection within their stokvels. The strong sense of community and camaraderie within stokvels was highly prized, with participants valuing the opportunity to interact with others and engage in collective activities. Stokvels function as informal associations deeply rooted in social cohesion, empowering members to collectively pursue their goals by offering financial support, fostering a sense of belonging, and providing mutual assistance. Through pooling their resources and supporting one another, stokvel members reported that they experienced a shared prosperity that enhances their overall well-being and alleviates individual hardships.

It is noteworthy that the project team had a very strong representation of women researchers. The PI, Prof Vicki Lambert, and two of her three co-investigators were all women including Dr Feyisayo Odunitan-Wayas and Dr Olufunke A. Alaba.
c) Policy engagement:

The project team engaged in dialogues with the Western Cape Government Department of Health and Wellness to explore the possibility of expanding their health promotion initiative, Westerncape on Wellness (WoW!), to include stokvels. This expansion would entail inviting stokvel leaders or members to undergo training as wellness champions (https://www.westerncape.gov.za/westerncape-on-wellness/). The team views this as a potential avenue for leveraging the social capital inherent in these savings groups and establishing connections between local government and stokvels.

Two other manuscripts are under preparation.
Other outputs:

1. A webpage is also under construction. The webpage will contain a summary of the project, major findings, and other informational resources. For example, there will be a section which explains the DCE results in layperson's terms so that readers can explore those factors that influence their food choice decisions and those of their stokvel. This information may be useful for stakeholders, local government health and food systems actors. The website will also include other informational resources such as recipes for healthy and cultural salient meals, and tips for storing fresh food. Once completed, the webpage will be hosted and maintained on website of the Health through Physical Activity, Lifestyle and Sport (HPALS) Research Centre at the University of Cape Town.
2. A social media community page for stokvels:
https://www.facebook.com/groups/141567165682281. This page was developed to engage stokvel members in discussion about how to make healthier food choices, even on a budget.
3. If appropriate, explain why outputs were not completed or were of poor quality. Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

The project's proposal was very strong, and the project team was led by a highly accomplished researcher. However, the project's implementation was marred by delays with submitting and revising technical and financial reports. While such delays are not unusual, the general lack of responsiveness of the grantee was quite frustrating. This situation was further compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic which made it difficult to monitor the project more rigorously. Overall, even though the project largely met its objectives, and even though the available outputs are of acceptable quality, the project's implementation fell below expectation. Thus, there is not a lot of confidence that the pending outputs will be completed in the foreseeable future. For example, even though the social media page for stokvels was launched in October 2023, it has been inactive ever since.

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

--- Page 3 ---

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

The key findings of this project are as follows:
a) Women-led grocery stokvels serve as crucial platforms to exercise economic power and engage in collective decision-making. Stokvels provide women with opportunities to exert influence, participate in community development, and pursue selfreliance, economic autonomy, and financial security. Moreover, they encourage social unity and camaraderie among participants, serving not just as savings and investment platforms but also instilling financial prudence and curbing impulsive spending. Stokvels enable members to make thoughtful grocery purchases, considering aspects like discounted rates and bulk options, resulting in organized and less frequent shopping habits.
b) Access to healthy food was not an important consideration among stokvels. The project found that there was no real demand for affordable access to healthy food among grocery stokvels. Some of the contributing factors included members' perceptions of healthy food being costly, requiring excessive effort, time, or electricity for preparation, transportation constraints or simply lacking awareness of what constitutes healthy food.
c) Despite their combined purchasing strength, stokvels remained subject to the whims of larger actors in the food system. "Big box" retailers and wholesalers wield considerable influence in determining food pricing, negotiating favourable contracts, and controlling product availability, potentially placing stokvels at a disadvantage. So, although stokvels can empower their members through collective action and promote financial inclusivity, they generally lack the leverage and economies of scale available to larger actors in the food system. Consequently, stokvels might encounter difficulties in securing competitive pricing, accessing affordable credit, and maneuvering through the intricate financial environment dominated by these entities.
d) Stokvels can be motivated to prioritize purchasing healthy food. Results of the DCE suggest that options such as bulk purchases of fruits and vegetables from local farmers and establishing stokvel-owned vegetable gardens are significant motivating factors for stokvels to purchase healthy food. Additionally, short courses focusing on healthy food topics were identified as potentially influential. However, factors like discount vouchers for healthy food and nutrition labels appeared to have no impact on stokvels' purchasing preferences.

The study made the following key recommendations:

1. Members of stokvels exhibited a keen interest to acquire and exchange knowledge on healthy food and food security. Therefore, stokvels could benefit from short courses designed to enhance understanding and expertise in various areas, including urban food gardening, nutrition, food preservation and budget-friendly healthy meal planning. By identifying community members, including stokvel leaders, as potential trainers or advocates and providing them with necessary resources, this objective can be achieved. Ideally, collaboration with government departments responsible for agriculture, social development, and health, supported by non-governmental organizations, could facilitate the realization of this objective.
2. Establishing partnerships with local farmers could enhance stokvels' ability to access fresh, nutritious produce. Stokvels could play a pivotal role in revitalizing local food economies by directing their collective purchasing power towards local entities like smallscale farms, community grocery stores, and local markets. This approach could stimulate local economies and promote more sustainable food supply chains. Furthermore, the pooled resources within stokvels could be strategically invested in supporting foodrelated businesses or agricultural initiatives, such as community farming projects, local food processing enterprises, or member-owned small businesses. This not only offers potential returns for stokvel members but also fosters local food production, adds value,

and encourages diversification. Finally, stokvels have the potential to mobilize and advocate for food policies that advance a more equitable and resilient food system.
5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?
Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

There were no unintended outcomes from this project. The project timelines were delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic and staffing issues, so a nine-month no-cost extension was approved. The project was also unable to secure the cooperation of the National Stokvel Association of South Africa (NASASA). The project had hoped that they could use NASASA as an entry point to engage with their members. However, NASASA was unresponsive, and the team had to find other ways to identify and recruit Stokvel members into their study.
6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.
Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

We experienced repeated delays in getting financial reports. The PI attributed this to a high staff turnover in the finance department at University of Cape Town. Even so, there was general lack of responsiveness from the PI and her team especially towards the final year of the project.

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

# PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

**IDRC CRDI**

Operationally, this project suffered multiple delays due to the Covid-19 pandemic and staff turnover. There was also a general lack of responsiveness from the PI. These delays necessitated a nine-month no-cost extension.

## 10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project?

You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

Ethical approvals were received as planned.

### Program Leader comments

**Program Leaders** (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

This project was seen by the FEH program as an opportunity to explore an alternative and innovative systemic intervention in the South African food system with health and nutrition impacts in low income communities. The challenges with, and results of the project suggest some limitations of the idea and the implementing team. The lack of cooperation from NASASA is perhaps indicative that the engagement of this key stakeholder, influencer and policy making body should have been established at the outset. Involving them (and others) in the design of the project may have led to a significantly different process and outcomes and more effort should have been made to confirm the validity of the idea and research with local stakeholders. It was a largely academic-led project and initiative. However, the project provides some worthwhile learning about the potential (or lack thereof) of Stokvels and the weaknesses of the broader food system within which they operate. There are some parallels in this learning with other more recent work to identify the potential and processes for small and medium enterprises to play greater roles in increasing accessibility to healthier foods when there are few incentives to do so.

### Director comments

**The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.**

The project aimed to explore the potential of grocery stokvels and informal savings groups to increase access to healthy food in South Africa, where obesity and non-communicable diseases are prevalent. It produced new knowledge on the challenges and opportunities for enabling women-led stokvels to access healthy food, such as partnering with local farmers, providing short courses on nutrition and food gardening, and advocating for food policies.

The PCR highlights the significant role stokvels play in ensuring household food security, providing social support, and contributing to economic empowerment. Recommendations included forming partnerships with local farmers, providing short courses, and advocating for improved access to healthy food for stokvels. The project also emphasized the potential for stokvels to revitalize local food economies and stimulate sustainable food supply chains. These initiatives align with IDRC's strategic objectives of investing in knowledge and innovation for large-scale change and building the leaders of today and tomorrow.

This project stands as an exemplary illustration of IDRC's transitional moment towards the 2030 vision in CRFS. As highlighted in this PCR, it demonstrates the significance of adopting a Food Systems approach to foster the transformation towards a more inclusive and healthier food system.
