# Project Highlights 

What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

## Policy Impact

In both Argentina and Brazil, the project had a relevant role in the approval of the Food Front of Package (FOP) labelling laws. In Argentina the law was published in November 2021 Ley 27642 Promocion de la Alimentacion Saludable followed by the implementation decree 151/2022 Decreto 151/2022 published in March 2022. This was a major outcome given the technical and advocacy role played by FIC Argentina resulting in one of the strongest and most comprehensive regulations on healthy FOP food labelling globally. The law promotes healthy food consumption regulations, including the new FOP food labelling policy, as well as the regulation of school food environments and food marketing to children. As in the case of Brazil, it also made a strong contribution by providing the legal rationale and arguments to counterbalance the critiques made by strategic stakeholders opposed to the policy. In Brazil, though the FOP food policy approved by the Brazilian Sanitary Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) includes a magnifying lens format instead of the octogonal format proposed by IDEC (following similar patterns as in Chile, Peru and Uruguay), a mandatory new FOP nutritional label policy was successfully approved in October 2020. In Brazil, IDEC also played a relevant role as part of the committee convened by ANVISA in the development of the new policy. The approval of the regulation in a difficult political scenario, even if it is not as aligned with public health interest as possible, was considered a political win for the Brazilian civil society and a step forward in Brazilian public health nutritional policies.

## Strong Knowledge Translation Strategy

A strong knowledge Translation Strategy (KTS) was developed in both countries. In Argentina, FIC was involved in key instances of collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Social Development, playing a strong role in the Commission for Healthy Eating and Obesity Prevention. FIC was engaged in more then 30 meetings with decision makers from the Legislative Branch and representatives from the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Agriculture. It was engaged in 10 policy dialogues at the Senate and Congress and was in charge of the review and recommendations made to eight draft bills, including the bill that was approved. It was part of two crucial meetings at the Senate and Chamber of Deputies where different actors from the government, civil society and industry discussed the draft bill. In parallel, a strong communication campaign with developed with more than 450 media hits published in newspapers, new agencies, radios, television and digital media. FIC Argentina was the first civil society organization with access to the Mercosur meetings where the FOP nutritional policy was discussed. UNICEF and FIC Argentina convened the National Coalition to Prevent Obesity in Children that played a very active advocacy role, with the support of PAHO, FAO and multiple civil society organizations. Multiple KTS tools were developed (public campaigns, videos, policy briefs) that are included as Outputs of the project. In social networks the campaign was released through Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, with the latter having a greater impact (the campaign had over 1 million impressions and reach, and generated a 500\% increase in page views). On Instagram in one year FIC increased from 300 people to an average reach of 2,000 people per post related to the FOP labelling campaign. On Twitter, FIC increased from 20,000 impressions per month to a peak of 192,000 impressions per month.

Based on the results and outputs of the project, strong advocacy and communication campaigns were launched by IDEC in Brazil in partnership with civil society and academic partners. IDEC was a key player of the Working Group convened by ANVISA to plan the new FOP food labelling policy. IDEC worked with researchers of the Center of Epidemiological Research in Nutrition and Health of the University of Sao Paulo to provide the best advice to ANVISA. IDEC's website Feeding Policies (Alimentando Politicas) was used by a national healthy coalition (the Alliance for Adequate and Healthy Diets) in support the FOP label policy. Policy briefs, technical documents, and a short documentary on industry interference in food policy development called: "Big Food: the power of the ultra-processed industry" were hosted in the website. A regional event was organized by IDEC and FIC in Brazil that took place in November 2019 with the participation of multiple policy makers, researchers and civil society organizations to discuss and promote regional policies on FOP food labelling based on the warning model and PAHO nutrients profile (see also the link to the table with the project outputs).

New scientific evidence and methods
In both countries relevant legal and policy evidence was developed as part of a collaborative process. It provided key insights specific to each country and sound arguments in support of the advocacy and policy influence campaign. FIC Argentina was the only organization in the country that provided local original new scientific evidence demostrating the effectiveness of the warning FOP labelling model as an outcome of the results provided by the project. The analysis of the effectiveness of different FOP food labels was done by IDEC in Brazil in the context of a previous IDRC funded project (108166) and used during the consultation process convened by ANVISA. In Argentina, the multidisciplinary research team applied new methods such as Discrete Choice Experiments (DEC) to assess the purchase intent of different FOP label models, and the use of analogies to adapt the legal arguments used in support of other public heath policies (as tobacco control policies). A complementary new research activity was developed to analyze the cost of healthy and unhealthy diets in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The cost gap significantly increased in 2020 during the lockdowns. The food price analysis was based on the use of big data that is proposed as a valuable method to increase the accuracy of price estimations.

# Building of Capacities 

In the two countries, individual and institutional capacities were strengthened during this project in terms of the scientific skills, use of new research methods, convening role, and the use of advocacy and media tools. The project enabled FIC to increase its legitimacy and leadership as a public health organization in Argentina. Victoria Tiscornia completed her Master's postgraduate training, her thesis work was published in the national journal of Public Health and contributed to the political discussion of the new law. Luciana Castruonovo completed a postgraduate course on Data Collection in Health, Camila Chidiak was trained on environmental communication, Florencia Camara (economist) pursued a diploma on Data Science, and Leila Guarnieri acquired new skills in qualitative data analysis. The entire team received a one day training course on communication and oral presentations, and gained key experience during the project. FIC institutional strengthening process, supported by IDRC during this and previous projects, contributed to gain an important grant from Bloomberg Philantropies.

## Binational Collaboration and Regional Networking

A relevant outcome of the project was the consolidation of the binational collaboration and development of working links with other public health nutrition regional organizations such as IECS Argentina, the

--- Page 2 ---

CLAS regional advocacy network, CINUT-INTA Chile and multiple others that joined the regional workshop. This project contributed to strengthen the leadership role that IDEC Brazil plays at the national and regional level as a key organization with a sound approach to sustainable and healthy food systems. The emergence and approval of the Regional Community of Practice project (109035) was in part due to the collaborative regional networking promoted by this project.

Project Outcomes
4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

The two teams made relevant contributions by providing sound scientific outcomes in support of the new FOP food labelling policies at the national and regional level, by consolidating and disseminating the evidence as part of strong knowledge translation strategies, involving strategic national and regional stakeholders aligned with the promotion of healthy and sustainable food systems and setting the basis for a regional community of practice.

How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?
Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

The results go beyond the expectations in terms of the role played by the project in the two countries in support of the approval of the two new FOP food label policies. Moreover, they could successfully adapt their strategy, research tools and activities to the COVID-19 context and ensure the continuity of

the project despite the departure of two key researchers. FIC Argentina project leader, Lorena Allemandi a key player in the field of healthy food systems, was contracted by PAHO. FIC Argentina's high qualified lawyer, Belen Ríos, a young and dynamic researcher and activist woman in the field of human and public health rights, left FIC to work with the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law. Unfortunately, she passed away in 2021, and was a very important loss for all regional players committed to work in favor of better public health conditions in Argentina and Latin America.

How did this project contribute one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?
Refer to the Strategic Plan. Provide specific numbers where possible.
Invest in knowledge and innovation for large-scale positive change
Build the leaders for today and tomorrow
Be the partner of choice for greater impact
It made significant contributions to the three strategic objectives. The novel evidence-based policies promoting healthier food environments and empowering consumers to make healthier food choices will have a large-scale positive impact by contributing to reduce the epidemics of obesity and non communicable chronic diseases.

The project made a significant contribution to increase the legitimacy and leadership of FIC Argentina and IDEC in the field of healthy food environments and food systems. It also increased the research and advocacy capacities of both teams. IDRC support through several projects, contributed to position themselves as cutting-edge civil society regional institutions.

FIC Argentina and IDEC have emerged as key partners of international organizations as UNICEF and PAHO/WHO and have accessed to funding from other donors as Bloomberg Philanthropies.

Financial performance
Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

The two institutions have experience in managing IDRC grants and had no financial problems. Due to the impact of COVID-19 and the potential to influence the approval of the new policy, the Argentinian component was extended. During the extension period it performed beyond expectations and played a key role in the approval of the new FOP food label law.

Strategic Considerations
Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

In the PAD, no important risks were envisaged that could have negatively affected the implementation of the project or reputation of IDRC. By convening two strong teams, they were effectively capable to address the pandemic and achieve its objectives. Despite the change of government in Brazil (affecting the Direction of ANVISA), IDEC continued to play a relevant role and represented the civil society in this process. The support of a vast network of civil society institutions and international UN agencies was an important asset of the project in both countries. The emphasis done on the collaboration between both teams was very well taken and expanded to involve a broader set of regional organizations.

Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional

and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

Ethical issues were well addressed. The two country teams were well equipped to comply with all relevant ethical issues.

Program Leader / Manager comments
Program Leaders/Managers should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

# Director comments 

The relevant Program or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

The project contributed to the implementation of a food consumption information and guidance system in two countries in Latin America and the Caribbean where the issue of food labeling and quality is of special sensitivity. The selection of the institutions in each country under study, the support for their collaboration at the regional level, and the consolidation of evidence on the comparative cost of access to food according to its nutritional contributions demonstrated IDRC's success in selecting this route of work for effective evidence-based advocacy at the national and regional levels. The strategy of sensitization of actors used by the research institutions, positioning this theme as a central component in the management of development policies at the domestic level and of international insertion of these two countries in food markets, was a creative and effective spring to achieve the rapid visibility of a necessary and effective solution.

The subsequent generation and integration of these two research institutions, with more experience and enhanced capacities, in a new community of practice at the regional level, augurs a successful trajectory in the expected advances in this field of informed food consumption at the regional and global levels.
