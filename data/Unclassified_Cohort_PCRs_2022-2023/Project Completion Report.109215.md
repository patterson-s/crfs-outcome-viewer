# Project Abstract 

Socioeconomic progress in Latin America has failed to extend equally across the continent's territories and is currently facing environmental and social pressures related to climate change. There is also a growing distance between the solutions policymakers promote, and the assessment that local communities make themselves of what's needed.

The Latin American Center for Rural Development (RIMISP) is a leading research network that articulates and generates knowledge to understand the transformations of rural societies and promote the development of Latin American territories. With this project, RIMISP aims to contribute to improve the well-being of left behind territories from four Latin American countries, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Colombia, through the innovation of conceptual and practical approaches to development dynamics.

Leveraging on RIMISP's success implementing a territorial perspective, this project contributed to fostering local coalitions' empowerment and advancing an inclusive territorial development agenda. This process supports change in the living conditions of persistently excluded groups, informing how they perceive these conditions and the impact that this agenda has on them. In practice, the project (i) facilitates dialogue and processes leading to the formulation and implementation of agreements and models of governance for territorial development and (ii) implements a toolbox of researchaction methodologies, daily-life indicators, and a social learning platform accounting for territorial voices to document changes in the perception of well-being before and during the implementation of a territorial development agenda.

Overall, the project contributes towards the generation of dynamics for inclusive territorial development, which links strengthened public, private and civil society actors, with special attention placed on young women and men.

# PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS 

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?
2. Socially inclusive coalitions were conformed or strengthened and engaged in territorial development processes. In spite of the Covid-19 pandemic, which allowed just a few months of work before the outbreak, the coalitions could be conformed in the four territories, they are functioning, and they have achieved several activities, such as the creation of Territorial Development Agenda, regular meetings, and devised Advocacy Strategies and developed Cooperation Agreements with public or private actors. Their basis and conformation process varies according to the situation, whether actors and organisations were fragmented before or were already part of a coalition. Mexico (Sierra Norte de Puebla) was an example of the later, where the community is the basis of the coalition and includes the municipality authorities of Ixtacamaxtitlán, social leaders and young people who have participated in the project's training (see below). The project allowed including other actors to the existing coalition such as the "Probosque de Mexcaltepec" and "Protección ecológica y medio ambiente de Tepexoxuca". The coalition in El Salvador (Ahuachapán Sur) emerged from a context of fragmentation of organisations with a few tacit coalitions that linked people with common objectives. The strengthening of the coalition has translated into converging part of the fragmentation into a group with greater cohesion and common objectives, merging participants of two institutionalised bodies (Mesa Agropecuaria Municipal and the Comisión Nacional de la Micro y Pequeña Empresa (CONAMYPE)).
3. Young men and women were trained and are part of the coalitions. Over the three years of the project, a total of 130 young people enrolled in trainings addressing common conjunctures and challenges in Latin America and the subregions; youth political participation in Latin America; participatory methodologies (such as photovoice and systematisation of experiences); socio-territorial conflicts and territorial defence; perception of well-being; agriculture and innovation; and social coalitions and dialogue.
4. Territorial Development Agendas. The coalitions developed Territorial Development Agendas, giving particular attention to youth and gender. Mexico and El Salvador were the first territories that reached their territorial development agenda after a little more than two years of work. The Peruvian coalition first reached an oral agreement and later translated it on paper. The Colombian coalition developed agendas at three municipalities (Pradera, Florida, and Tuluá) to facilitate their implementation, even though the members of the coalition agreed on them collectively.

The participation of women, a focus of the project, was significant in the development of these agreements, particularly in Peru and Colombia. In Peru, the local partner Cedepas organised empowerment trainings for 20 women, addressing self-knowledge, self-esteem, communication and negotiation skills; women's rights, gender approach, gender inequalities; legal framework, behavioural patterns, political advocacy, and gender equity in the agenda and implementation of plans. Through these trainings, they developed a Women's

Agenda, which they used as input for the Territorial Development Agenda and its management.
4. Advocacy to reach Cooperation Agreements with public or private actors The advocacy approach of the project to implementation the Territorial Development Agendas adopted strategies that varied according to contexts and possibilities in responding to three main questions: (1) How to achieve the prioritized objectives of the Territorial Development Agenda; (2) How to materialise them; and (3) potential allies in this task and what the results could be at the short (at the end of the project), medium and long term. A very useful guidance document for the development of these strategies was produced to guide the teams in their advocacy activities. See question 9 for details of each county.
5. Perception of well-being by youth and women. The process of coalition building was supported by a reflection on well-being, where activities such as photovoice, workshops, interviews and surveys (including an overall Territorial Quality of Life and Subjective Well-being Survey) were conducted. The project shows that as a result of their participation in the process of territorial development the awareness of youth and women regarding what is considered wellbeing has evolved and they developed a common narrative about what aspects of daily life make up living well. Results showed that it relates to: (1) food production as a central point of well-being; (2) the biocultural heritage, traditional knowledge and the threat of pollution; (3) limited access to education and mobility; (4) youth leadership and exclusion in the territories; and (5) the situation of women and the demand for changes in gender roles. Then the idea was to generate dialogues about what they want for the territory and how they represent living well. For example, in Mexico this allowed participants to move from an opposition to "death projects" (mainly represented by mining projects) to a proactive narrative of "life projects". These life projects, expressed in the narrative, projection and agency (in the work of the coalitions), actively promote living well (well-being) rather than merely resisting to exogenous factors.

# PROJECT OUTCOMES 

## 2. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

This project was very successful in terms of advocacy and policy influence using research evidence. It documents pathways for building and strengthening coalitions, as well as for developing and adopting territorial development agenda and cooperation agreements among public and private actors in different contexts and countries. It explores, analyses and documents advocacy strategies and capacity building related to advocacy work, and it measures how this whole process impacts on the life of people through indicator of well being that measure the perception of actors. The project showed that the process of establishing coalitions that have the capacity to participate and influence territorial development, as well as to represent and convene diverse actors, is intense, and it takes time, but it's rewarding for the participants. Experiences such as this one, which generate positive experiences of participation, are fundamental for communities to strengthen or rearticulate their organization, their objectives, and their social fabric. See below a summary of each territory's journey:

- In Mexico, the coalition took advantage of the municipal election context to present their Agenda on environmental, soil and native forest protection to the municipal candidates and later got involved in the development of a land-use plan, given common grounds between their Agenda and the government programme. Although no signed public-private cooperation agreement has been reached, a road improvement plan was agreed with the municipality of Ixtacamaxtitlán. This is a strategic engagement for the coalition as it relates to its Agenda, addressing water, agriculture, life projects, and the protection of forests.
- In El Salvador, the support of different territorial actors and organisations was used to propose a Technical Agricultural and Livestock Unit with an agro-ecological vision at the municipal level. The innovation of this strategy is that it seeks to formalise the Unit through a municipal ordinance and using public funds available to the municipalities (the unit is still waiting for its approval by municipal decree, due to be approved at the next municipal council).
- In Colombia, the coalitions' strategy was to prioritise one action per municipality, which allowed women to strengthen their organisational processes and institutional articulation. This exercise was done by developing a plan including women's productive projects to present detailed proposals focused on the needs of each municipality. In the municipality of Pradera, for example, cooperation with the Secretariat of Rural Development, led to the signature of a public cooperation agreement, to deliver inputs and materials for the strengthening of vegetable gardens and community nurseries (which corresponded to the proposal made by women).

- In Peru, the strategy consisted in building the capacities of young farmers in the creation of their business plans associated with family farming. Then strategy involved to accompany them in the presentation of these plans in the context of calls for tenders and open competition for public funds and to seek support from the private sector. This allowed strengthening relationships so that the youth remain in the territory and perpetuate family farming. One of the results was a public cooperation agreement signed with Agricultural Cooperative of Small Organic Banana Producers.

3. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?
Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

This project has produced several outputs, results and lessons in spite of the COVID pandemic. The team has been very quick to adapt and to propose a B plan a few weeks after the COVID hit, once it was clear that a return to the normal was not happening in a close future. This project involved building trust and relationship between different types of actors, including local grassroot actors, youth and women as well as policy makers and private sector. This requires sustained, in person activities and meetings. Their Plan B involved virtual and face-to-face meetings, reducing group size given the restrictions in place. Their "modular coalitions" featured smaller groups of actors, in person when possible, and virtually when it was not. The process was iterative, with successive modules rotating in composition in order to distribute discussions and resolutions. This plan represented a challenge in terms of time and resources, but it was successful in unblocking the coalition process, though progress was timid and difficult. The composition of the research team also included community liaisons (to accompany the coalition building process) that turned out to be a key intermediation link between the rest of the team and the communities, contributing to improve communication and presence in the territories. Once restrictions on meetings and movements were lifted coalitions resumed their functioning, and significant progress was made in a short time. Although according to initial plans, there was a delay in achieving all the Territorial Development Agreements, these were reached by the first quarter of 2022.
4. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.
Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

The project was developed under the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan and it contributes to IDRC Corporate priorities of that period. It built leaders through the strengthening of coalitions, composed of around 30 key actors within the territories such as social organizations, grassroot organisations and authorities, and that promote change. It also capacitated these actors with advocacy skills to develop territorial agreements. These trainings focussed on youth and women, with 130 young people trained in the course of the project on advocacy, policy and agriculture innovation. It supported and consolidated the knowledge and lessons from Rimisp territorial development approach, expanding the knowledge generated through methodological innovation and evidence-based governance models that will stay with communities and expand as they continue their action. The project allowed the re-articulation of the community social ties and opened spaces for people to get involved. The focus on advocacy aimed to engage with actors of

--- Page 6 ---

diverse natures, especially the public ones, rather than only working within coalitions that were rather oriented towards civil society actors in the first place. This focus on policy influence using research lessons, clearly position the project in line with current IDRC focus on knowledge translation. It led to important lessons on methods and strategies to influence policy in terms of advocacy, and decision-making in public policies, and to strengthen the agency of social actors and organisations.

This project had also parallel funding by the Ford Foundation, who funded the same studies in other territories. It consolidates IDRC's position as one of the key players at the nexus of food systems and rural development in Latin America, at a time where social conflicts including those related to access and use of land and natural resources are increasing.

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

7. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

The PAD highlighted the difficulties to ensure the interest, trust and by-in of local actors including governments and the private sector to support the implementation of territorial development agendas, the strategy was to work in territories where the team had prior experience with actors, and where governmental counterparts support the territorial development process. They also worked directly with grassroot organisations (CesderProdes in Mexico and Aproba-Sank in Guatemala) and with alliances of teams that links with grassroot actors (Cedepas Norte in Peru, Fundación Prisma in El Salvador), which generated positive results in terms of local presence, trust, and agility in the face of the COVID pandemic. The strategy was good and well sustained by their local knowledge and influence and their capacity building efforts, which allowed achieving agreements in all territories.

What was not planned for was the COVID pandemic, which imposed restrictions on meetings and travels in all territories. In reaction they were quick to adapt and adopted a modular model for the coalition meetings, which allowed to continue advancing, even at reduced pace, and when travels and meeting resumed, they could make progress quickly. Political unrest was also contemplated as a risk, and it did impact the project implementation in Colombia, where the formation of coalitions with social organisations and territorial actors suffered delays because of the 2021 Colombian National Strike, which was particularly intense in the Valle del Cauca. But the coalition was eventually conformed, and activities resumed and, in the end, progress advanced as in the other territories of the project.

The PAD also discussed the risk of not being able to achieve the project's objectives (coalitions conformed and functioning, territorial development agendas and cooperation agreements) and to demonstrate the impact of the territorial approach in the three-year project timeframe, given that socio-political processes take time. The mitigation strategy was to parallelly co-develop with coalition members daily life indicators and "perception" of well-being before and during the implementation of territorial development agendas. It proved useful, even if the first survey could not be achieved before the process as it coincided with the worse moments of the COVID pandemic. However, the participatory process that accompanied and was embedded within the work of the coalitions led to the collection of territorial voices that critically discuss territorial well-being. This generated lessons on how the actors perceived their journey in this process and how it can impact their well being. In addition, the participatory action research embedded within the framework of the coalitions allowed the appropriation of the research process and information generated. The indicators generated in the territories are felt as their own and make sense as a tool to account for the territorial reality. In some cases, there is an

--- Page 8 ---

ongoing appropriation of the advocacy potential of the results. For example, in Colombia, the information generated has been returned to the territories, and results have been appropriated as evidence for advocacy and dialogue.
8. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

One valuable lesson presented by the PO in this PCR is the critical role of forming socially inclusive coalitions and strengthening existing ones in driving territorial development processes. Despite the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, RIMISP successfully formed coalitions in multiple territories, showcasing their resilience and professionalism once more. These coalitions have not only functioned effectively but have also achieved significant milestones, including the creation of Territorial Development Agendas, regular meetings, and the development of cooperation agreements with public and private actors.

Another important aspect is the active involvement and training of young men and women as integral members of the coalitions. As summarized by the PO, during the three-years of the project, the project trained the substantive number of 130 young people on various topics such as youth political participation, participatory methodologies, socio-territorial conflicts, and more. This investment in the capacity building of the youth population is not only beneficial for the project but also contributes to the sustainable long term development of the territories and the empowerment of the younger generation, women in particular.
The development of Territorial Development Agendas, with a particular emphasis on youth and gender, stands as a significant achievement. I want to highlight the participation of women in shaping these agendas has been significant, thanks to dedicated empowerment trainings and their active involvement.

The lessons and results of this project highlight the significance of socially inclusive coalitions, youth empowerment, gender inclusion, and strategic advocacy in driving territorial development processes and promoting knowledge sharing among stakeholders.
