# Project Abstract 

Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest level of food and nutrition insecurity in the world and even though a number of interventions are rightly being implemented, access to accurate and reliable information on nutrition and the health situation of individuals, including children, is severely lacking. This problem is intensified due to the time consuming and expensive primary data collection methods, especially challenging in remote locations. With strong national and international investments to reduce all forms of malnutrition, it is essential to find reliable fieldfriendly ways to collect information that can be readily available for making decisions on nutrition interventions.

The project addressed this data gap by developing an information and communications technology (ICT) based platform for collecting real time nutrition data. It was based on the growing recognition that digital platforms can support transformational advances in agriculture, nutrition and other sustainable development objectives by combining the accuracy and frequency of recording events in near-real time with the low-cost and ease.

Researchers developed a front-end mobile application designed to be user-friendly and operable, even by largely illiterate individuals, along with a back end-web system that serves as a database and dashboard for data analysis. Innovative ways by which households can provide their own data directly using icons, photos, interactive voice response and games were tested. Gender dynamics, including the capacity of women to access and use the data collection tools were carefully considered and addressed.

The mobile application was tested with several diverse communities in Kenya and results were closely monitored and validated through comparison of collected data with traditional methods and through engagement with other stakeholders in the nutrition sector.

The innovation would be valuable to monitoring systems for nutrition and food security interventions and will be made accessible to interested stakeholders involved in national and international programming.

# PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS 

## 1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

1) Development of a digital tool (mobile application): The project successfully developed a smartphoneaccessible health information tool for caregivers of young children in remote regions. This smartphone application (app) called Mbiotisho, which roughly translates as "our health" in the Samburu, one of the local languages in Kenya. The tool uses a simple audio and icon-based interface to help participants, many of whom are illiterate and have no experience of smartphones, report their own and their children's food consumption and health status. The caregivers, in turn, receive reports on status and trends in the information they reported, along with practical recommendations based on those reports. Household level

data collection by 189 study participants during a 54 week testing period showed a high level of submissions as seen by $83 \%$ sample submitted in at least 27 weeks (or about twice a month). This points to evidence that once proper training is provided, even illiterate study participants can consistently transmit simple repetitive data using meaningful symbols and audio cues.

## 2) Gender dynamics:

A cross cutting activity to understand gender dynamics of smartphone use by caregivers to collect smartphone-based high-frequency, high-resolution food consumption and young child health data directly from and to households revealed interesting insights which were used to inform deployment of the application. The study on a sub-sample of women participants in Marsabit District, Kenya showed that all the participants who conducted data collection were women from male-headed, female-managed homes. Illiteracy level was very high as most of the women had not gone through formal education but interestingly women had more access to mobile phones ( $94 \%$ ), although only $53 \%$ had control. This high access is attributed to the presence of development projects in the area that availed smartphones to the caregivers. Almost all the respondents were able to collect and enter data using the smart phones using either of the local language in the study site (Samburu and Rendille). The data collecction method was rated as simple to understand ( $88 \%$ ), faster ( $75 \%$ ), time saving and easy to submit ( $63 \%$ ). However, this study also provides key insights for use of the application in other locations where mobile phone exposure may not be very high. Low illiteracy levels among the respondents may hamper data collection and thus requires an extended period of training so that the respondents can internalize the process of data capture and submission and hence enhance the number of entries submitted. It was evident that some respondents were unable to submit data even though they captured it. This was mainly due to their inability to know if they had phone data bundles or not. Although women had access to the smartphones, the study showed that men still had control over their use, implying the need to involve both men and women in the project to avoid household conflict. Indeed, some women indicated that there were conflicts with their husbands during the training. However, men appeared to be more cooperative when they realised that there was a token payment which benefitted the family.

## 3) Accuracy and reliability testing

Initially the project employed community heath volunteers (CHV) to collect the same data from the participating caregivers who were measuring and recording on themselves. However, both the caregivers and CHVs submitted measurements that contained errors when collecting data for a standard anthropometric measurement, Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC). To address this issues around the large Technical Error of Measurement, researchers developed several additional datasets which relied on photos of correct MUAC measurements as a way to validate data submitted by caregivers and CHVs. The photos submitted by the caregivers also offered several strategies for screening out faulty measurements and/or developing alternative

benchmarks. These approaches further reduced the Technical Error of Measurement which is inherent to any data collection method. One advantage to ask caregivers themselves to collect data is the possiblity to collect the data more frequently which further reduces errors with minimal additional cost.
4) Monitoring and real-time feedback based on data

Another value of the app which received positive response was a customized feedback feature embedded in the app. This innovative feature within the app gives appropriate responses to dietary and anthropometric data collected by the caregivers. For example, if the MUAC of a child under 2 years was recorded as 12.5 cm or below (threshold for moderate malnutrition), the app's audio recommends the caregiver to immediately contact their local health worker or health facility. For diet related data, the app provides age-specific recommendations by the World Health Organization such as breastfeeding frequency or dietary diversity. A second feedback process added as a result of community interest was to provided feedback on the caregiver's own diet, for example, recommendation to consume a diverse diet which includes dark green leafy vegetables, fruits and animal source foods etc. These findings provided evidence for potential use of the app in behavioral change communications and nutrition education messages.
5) Opportunities for wider application in the international development

The versatility of the mobile application opened up a variety of opportunities for the project team to test how it can be adapted to different situations in addition to the two areas of diet and child health monitoring which were the main focus. For example,

- at the invitation of an FCDO funded DIRISHA project ((Drought Index-insurance for Resilience in the Sahel and Horn of Africa)) being managed by ILRI, the app was tested for use in a drought surveillance project to learn about the dynamic relationships between rangeland health, animal production, human consumption, and individual health.
- in collaboration with the World Food Programme, the National AIDs and STIs Control Program (NASCOP) and the Kilifi Department of Health, the app was adapted to be useful to monitor for changes to behavior, consumption or health among people living with HIV
- the tool was also applied to monitor child development by a PhD student at the Aga Khan University Institute for Human Development. The application disseminated and tested the impacts of messaging developed by the Child Development in Marginalized Communities parenting study.

# PROJECT OUTCOMES 

## 4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

The research was important to fund because many parts of Sub-Saharan Africa lack the current, accurate and reliable data on nutrition and health that could help to forge effective solutions to reducing malnutrition. Such data are critical to determining if policies and interventions are working and to identify ways to improving them.

The project contributed to this important research area through developing and testing a costeffective smartphone-based application, in different contexts, to improve the collection of highresolution (individual-level) and near-time dietary, nutrition and health data. The tool provides an alternative to traditional data collection approaches which are based on field enumerators, and it helps to close the gaps in data caused by seasonal changes. The application of this tool will help to make data-driven agriculture, nutrition and health policies and decisions to support nutritionsensitive food and agriculture systems.

During the testing phase, the versatility of the app opened opportunities to attract different partner organizations to identify ways in which the app can be useful for data collection. Accordingly, researchers were able to customize the app. For example,

- In collaboration with a Child Development in Marginalized Communities parenting study, the project's PhD student attached to the Aga Khan University Institute for Human Development tested the app among mothers of infants that were residents of informal settlements in the Eastleigh neighborhood of Nairobi.
- In collaboration with the World Food Programme and other partners, the app was tested to monitor for changes to behavior, consumption or health among people living with HIV AIDs.


## 5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

The development of the app evolved as detailed in the project approval document. However, for testing the app in different field conditions, an unexpected development due COVID-19 occurred. This was due to the researchers' inability to travel internationally as originally planned to test the app in two other countries in addition to Kenya. To address this, the researchers in discussion with IDRC decided to conduct the field testing in Kenya where most of the staff were located and so did not have to travel internationally. Careful selection of communities with diverse population groups within Kenya helped to test the app in a range of scenarios to collect data needed to validate the app.

## 6. How did this project contribute one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.

--- Page 4 ---

Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

The study was developed and implemented as part of the IDRC's 2015-2020 strategic plan. This project is a good example for the strategic objective of investing in knowledge and innovation for large scale positive change. This is mainly because the researchers developed and tested an innovative methodology and an app to collect real-time household diet and health related data. An application such as this is also timely given the need to identify options for research and data collections even during travel restrictions due to a global/regional crisis or due to populations living in difficult to access remote locations. The actual large-scale impact at scale is expected to materialize beyond the project time frame. For example, use of the tool developed in this project is anticipated in national surveys such as the routine Demographic and Health Surveys (conducted in 90 countries globally including 44 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa) where the protocols require sample sizes of about 15,000 households per country.

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

The recipient demonstrated a good understanding of IDRC project management practices and submitted technical and financial reports on time.

During the course of the project several adjustments were made to the budget within the overall project funding. A no-cost time extension of six months was granted which helped to makeup some of the delays caused due to COVID-19 the pandemic.

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

The overall risk for this project has been low, and the mitigation strategies outlined in the PAD were largely successful. The recipient was a low-risk institution, and it benefitted from the experience of researchers from ILRI who contributed key technical expertise for the design and testing of the app including experience in crowd sourcing data with pastoral communities.
10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

The project followed all relevant ethics protocols for collecting data with special attention given to electronic data collection where additional processes had to be put in place to ensure participant's identity is protected.

At the beginning of the project, the research protocol was presented to the Ministry of Health's Technical Working Group on Nutrition Research in Kenya. This was a first and necessary step to receiving ethics approval for nutrition research in Kenya. Formal ethics approval for testing the tool was granted by ILRI's ethics committee and Kenya's National Commission for Science, Technology and Innovation, the national body that approves all Scientific research in Kenya. During the course of the project, these approvals were updated and new approvals specific to implementation sites to reflect the evolution of the project were obtained.

## Program Leader / Manager comments

Program Leaders/Managers should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

## Director comments

The relevant Program or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

The project was originally conceived as a part of the IDRC's strategic plan for 2015-2020, which had the overarching goal of investing in knowledge and innovation to bring about significant positive changes on a

large scale. However, it's worth noting that the Project Officer has presented several examples that can be highly beneficial when shaping new initiatives in the region under the new 2030 vision. One illustrative case is how the project team considered and tackled gender-related dynamics, including ensuring that women can access and effectively use the data collection tools. That approach is now a normal part of the gender equality and inclusion framework.

From a more technological innovation standpoint, I would like to highlight the adaptability of the mobile application allowed for testing in various scenarios, going beyond the primary focus areas of dietary and child health monitoring. As presented in the PCR, the ICT-based platform developed for this project consisted of a front-end mobile application designed to be user-friendly and operable, even by largely illiterate individuals, along with a back-end web system that serves as a database and dashboard for data analysis. The mobile application used innovative ways for households to provide data directly using icons, photos, interactive voice responses, and games.

Of course, as suggested by the PO it is worth highlighting the importance of collaboration and partnerships in achieving project objectives. The project team worked closely with local partners, including community health workers and government officials, to ensure that the data collection tools were appropriate and effective. Additionally, the team collaborated with researchers from the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), who contributed key technical expertise for the design and testing of the app. This collaboration allowed for the successful development and implementation of the project and could serve as a model for future initiatives for CRFS in the region.

I approve this PCR
