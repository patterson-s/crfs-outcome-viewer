Project Highlights
What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

Tailored and responsive mentoring support for 6 research teams (approximately 60 people)
Following an initial face-to-face meeting with each team, from March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic prevented travel and in-person mentoring support, Gender at Work (G@W) mentors conducted regular virtual meetings with their respective research partners. Mentoring support was tailored to meet the specific needs and interests of the research teams. Mentors also responded to specific requests for support.

In Benin, for example, this involved developing guidelines for CREDEL to integrate gender into the elaboration of 8 community-based adaptation plans which influenced the quality of plans for 8 districts in Benin. In Nigeria, the G@W mentor worked with the team to develop community-specific training exercises for work with community project implementation committees to advance the inclusion of men in climate change and disaster risk actions. In response to the team's request, these exercises aimed at strengthening the capacity of men in families and communities, particularly their advocacy skills, in a way that builds strong support for women around climate change adaptation.

Critical to the success of mentoring was the structure of an on-going conversation between the mentor and the teams, along with the openness of teams to receive support and support/engagement from the responsible PO.

Three peer learning meetings with 6 research teams and CC Program team members

--- Page 1 ---

Teams shared their experiences and insights and honed their approaches at annual peer learning meetings - starting with a face-to-face workshop in Nairobi (November 2019), a virtual workshop in December 2020, and a final virtual workshop in December 2021.

The first workshop included 3 representatives from each research team and 3 CC program POs. It was a highly interactive event that was critical for developing relationships (among the cohort of projects and with G@W), and for setting the tone for an open and dynamic space for learning and questioning. The teams all developed a vision and strategy for their work on gender and developed preliminary plans for gender action learning. The second workshop was an opportunity for each team to share new learning and insights emerging from their work. The final workshop was an opportunity to share significant project outcomes and integrated a write shop component with an external writing consultant. The advantage of the virtual format was that additional research team members and all responsible POs and G@W mentors were able to participate.

New capacity of G@W to facilitate virtual workshops
Due to COVID-19 and limitations on travel, G@W had to adapt their usual face-to-face approach to peer learning workshops. Following a recommendation by the responsible PO, in September 2020, the team used project funds to engage Nancy White from Full Circle Associates to do a training session for G@W facilitators on approaches to virtual facilitation. The team also benefited from technical support of Andrea Fluck von Planta who accompanied the team for the first online peer learning meeting in December 2020. This support allowed G@W to gain new knowledge, skills and experience for providing engaging virtual spaces to support gender action learning processes.

Reflecting on this new way of working and challenges to embodied learning, G@W produced a resource, Building an android heart: Learning for gender justice, equality and diversity in an online world, that proposes a set of good practices and recommendations.

Increased capacity of 6 research teams - change in researchers' consciousness, perspectives, and knowledge on gender

While each of the research teams and individual members began with differing levels of capacity and commitment to conduct gender responsive/transformative research, and each followed their own trajectory of learning, the project made significant strides in increasing researchers' conceptual understanding, and consciousness on the value of gender in their research. The scale and nature of this change differed for individuals and teams, yet significant and positive shifts were observed for 5 of the 6 teams, in the quality of integrating gender and inclusion dimensions in the research approach, in the dynamics of teams (for example, valuing of gender experts in their team, efforts to be more inclusive), and leading to more gender impactful research outcomes.

Increased capacity of 6 Climate Change Program team members on gender
Through various moments of engagement with the G@W team, including a start-up meeting held in spring of 2019, a meeting in April 2021 to reflect on project progress, and a meeting in February 2022 to reflect on emerging learnings from the project and to conduct a preliminary outcome harvest process, CC team members had the opportunity to deepen their understanding of what kinds of approaches and conditions support grantee learning on gender and social inclusion, and how to effectively integrate these into their research activities. Through direct engagement with G@W mentors and with research teams, many of the responsible POs gained a deeper understanding of how to effectively integrate

gender into research - for example by reading the G@W mentor's questions and comments on technical reports, research reports, policy briefs, etc., and by participating in the tailored learning and reflection sessions facilitated by G@W mentors with research teams.

Outcomes from Gender at Work's support to IDRC - a learning review (June 21, 2022) by Barbara Klugman

If appropriate, explain why outputs were not completed or were of poor quality.
Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

The initial project plan envisioned conference presentations and at least one peer-reviewed publication. A revised project plan also included a blog series and newsletters, but none of these came to fruition. These outputs were not realized and did not get priority partly due to the change in approach resulting from the pandemic, and also since the project did not ultimately allocate sufficient budget, human resources, and time to account for project coordination and synthesis, beyond the specific work and activities carried out by G@W mentors. The need to budget for coordination and synthesis work is a lesson noted by G@W in their final technical report.

--- Page 3 ---

This project adds to IDRC's diverse experiences of trying to strengthen grantee and internal capacity for integrating gender and social inclusion considerations into research. The many and diverse outcomes for the 6 projects involved are documented in their respective FTRs and PCRs, and detailed in Barbara Klugman's report. Overall, it is notable that the support from G@W was instrumental in bolstering, and in some instances transforming, the capacity (individual, team, institution), approaches pursued, and outcomes achieved by at least 5 out of 6 projects involved.

At a minimum, the project strengthened the quality of gender-responsive research and promoted tailored and inclusive spaces for reflection, valuing the gender expertise in the team, and supporting all to enhance their capacity on and commitment to gender-integrated research. Individuals involved reported greater voice and visibility for women in the research teams - women gained confidence to claim their space in the team, expressing their views and becoming more active in shaping the research process. This also led to greater trust and collaboration within the teams. The increased capacity and confidence has had immediate impacts for some of the research institutions, for example CREDEL in Benin and CEPAD in Nigeria who have succeeded in attracting subsequent funding to pursue further development/research activities focused on gender and climate change adaptation.

Most exciting has been where the support from G@W was instrumental in shifting the nature of the research to be more gender transformative, and also influencing change at the level of the individual researchers, research team and even institution. A compelling example is project 108973 in Nepal, in which a core team composed of the gender leads from each of the three implementing partners worked closely with their G@W mentor and embraced the learning opportunity to advance gender transformative change through the research process and in their research team (for further details read the testimonies in Reflections from a Transformative Space, and find direct reference to the transformative impact of G@W's support in the project's FTR on page 28, section 8).

The project was also a timely contribution to building our internal capacity on gender, beginning prior to the increased attention to gender and social inclusion under IDRC's 2030 Strategy. By participating in G@W-led activities, POs gained an appreciation of how teams might be supported to pursue impactful gender-integrated research. POs were exposed to a different approach to capacity strengthening and witnessed what could be achieved through tailored, responsive and sustained mentoring support with research teams that are motivated and interested.

Further, G@W developed new knowledge, skills and insights from this project, as they were challenged to adapt their standard gender action learning approach a) to a research project context and, b) to the limitations imposed by a global pandemic. In particular, the experience gained in virtual facilitation is being applied in their work, including with other IDRC programs and grantees, as they have shifted to more hybrid options for running gender action learning processes.

How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?
Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

This project did different, less, and more than expected.
Different: By the end of year 1, we were already discussing how the originally proposed approach would need to shift to reflect the very different capacities and nature of each of the project teams. The revised plan was to prioritize more intensive face-to-face engagement with each research team in their

--- Page 4 ---

own locations. Then the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting limitations on travel derailed these plans, as well as the in-person peer learning events planned for years 2 and 3. The G@W team had to move to a purely virtual way of working - a difficult change given their deep appreciation for the power of in-person approaches to learning, connecting and exchange, but a shift they made successfully with training and technical support for the peer learning workshop in year 2 that resulted in new learning and skills for G@W.

Less: In hindsight, the project as originally scoped was overly ambitious, especially given the relatively low capacity of a couple of the research teams. Even with a shift in focus on objective 2 (capacity strengthening for research teams), several of the activities discussed with G@W to better nurture a community of practice among the research teams in between the peer learning events were not realized. Both G@W and the CC team underestimated the time and human resources required for coordination and synthesis to achieve the original project objectives.

Also, this project anticipated buy-in to the process by all 6 research teams since gender was a central focus of the projects, having been selected from the call for proposals on gender and climate change. In the end, one team was less interested in receiving mentoring support from G@W, and even if valued by other teams, engagement in the process of learning also required additional time not foreseen when they had developed their project plans.

More: As noted already, the project led to unanticipated learning and innovation on how to support virtual learning on gender and social inclusion. The second and third peer learning sessions were engaging and dynamic, including simultaneous translation to enable full participation of English, French and Spanish speakers. To overcome the technical barriers to virtual participation for some of the teams, the travel budget was reallocated to provide support where needed, whether additional IT equipment, or the option of renting a meeting space with more reliable internet connection.

In Year 3, outcome harvesting was introduced as an additional project methodology to document outcomes to which the project had contributed. Those engaged in this RSP were included in a wider outcome harvesting exercise being conducted by G@W with other IDRC programs, with the support outcome harvesting expert, Barbara Klugman. The project served as a pilot to test the methodology and preliminary results were validated with partners during the final peer learning meeting. This activity helped us to better assess and appreciate the diverse and significant influence of the project on learning and on project outcomes.

How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?
Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.

Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy.
Provide specific numbers where possible.
The project was developed under the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan. It contributed primarily to objective 2, by building leaders in gender-integrated climate change adaptation research. The mentorship relationship with G@W strengthened capacity and leadership of emerging researchers and established leaders in all 6 countries. It also strengthened the capacity of research organizations (especially in

Financial performance
Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

Key takeaways from the experience to inform future capacity strengthening efforts of this nature include:

Factor in time for coordination - To work, this kind of approach to capacity strengthening demands regular and active coordination with G@W. It's not a simple matter of contracting G@W to do the capacity strengthening but is best seen as a collaborative endeavour.

Budget for coordination and knowledge sharing - To ensure sufficient time and resources are available, ensure the budget includes funds for coordination and for synthesis, production of outputs and activities for strategic knowledge sharing.

--- Page 6 ---

Work with the willing - especially for a longer-term, time-intensive process like this, it's best to expose research partners to the learning opportunity and then solicit their interest (this is what the Think Tanks initiative did) rather than assuming research partners will buy-in. Giving teams the option to meet different G@W mentors and decide who would be a good fit might also help to set teams up for success.

Budget and plan for supporting different language groups - It proved critical to pair French and Spanish speaking research teams with G@W mentors who were fluent in French/Spanish. Translation of key documents and simultaneous translation for peer learning events also proved critical for ensuring active participation of all teams.

PO support is critical - POs' engagement sends a strong message to research partners that the process is valued and important. POs also benefit from the learning opportunity. That said, it can be advantageous to not be involved in each and every interaction, given the power dynamic that can exist with the donor. Involvement in the start-up stage would be especially important and POs should maintain regular communication with mentors, share technical reports, etc..

Support with additional subject-matter expertise - G@W colleagues are experts on gender, not on research on climate change adaptation. We drew on visiting fellow Sophia Huyer given her expertise on gender AND climate change adaptation and she added important thematically relevant perspectives and examples that really inspired and spoke to the research partners.

# Strategic Considerations 

Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

The risk mitigation strategies were mainly effective, in particular to ensure collaboration between G@W, the CC program team and the grantees; to sustain interest and engagement among grantees over the three years' project timeframe; to design a process that was dynamic and interactive. However, despite repeated attempts to reach out, the team in Bangladesh (108960) elected not to work with the G@W mentor for most of the duration of the project. The team did continue to participate actively in the annual peer learning events. This experience speaks to the risk of imposing capacity strengthening support on grantees versus offering the support and working with those who are motivated.

The major unanticipated risk was a global pandemic. Nevertheless, the team proved adept at adapting their approach, and overcoming the challenges resulted in significant learning and innovation.

Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

No lessons to report.
Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

# Director comments 

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

The project has been a contribution to building IDRC (CRFS in particular) internal capacity on gender, beginning prior to the increased attention to gender and social inclusion under IDRC's 2030 Strategy. By participating in G@W-led activities, POs gained an appreciation of how teams might be supported to pursue impactful gender-integrated research. POs were exposed to a different approach to capacity strengthening and witnessed what could be achieved through tailored, responsive and sustained mentoring support with research teams that are motivated and interested. As presented in this PCR, the lessons and process of this project did contribute to not only the narrative of gender in climate action in general, but the whole Gender and inclusion framework thinking of the CRFS PIP.
