Project Highlights
What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

New knowledge generated and documented from a highly fragile region on drivers of vulnerabilities and climate-change impacts on rural households, particularly on women farmers, and how they cope. The study took place in three main ecological zones of the Niger Delta region-mangrove swamp (Delta South Senatorial District), freshwater swamp (Delta Central Senatorial District), and lowland rainforest (Delta North Senatorial District)—and included an extensive collection of primary data on household vulnerability and current and potential climate-related risks to agricultural activities based on experiences of loss, levels of concern, perceptions of change, and the identification of common practices and strategies to manage climate-related risks as well as needs for adaptation. They found that women's and men's capacities for building disaster and climate resilience were shaped by their social, cultural, economic, and natural resource management roles. Information came from a baseline survey of 4,000 households, interviews with 107 key informants, 30 focus group discussions (11 to 15 participants, comprising all men, all women, or a mix of men and women), and 3 feedback meetings with communities. The project also included an assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on local food production and informal food markets based on a survey of 2,000 farmers (comprising 600 food producers, 600 food marketers, and 800 households). The results of both studies are useful because Niger Delta's climate-related disasters, and other disasters such as COVID-19, are understudied, this region is hard to access and investigate, and existing research lacks adequate data and focuses on isolated environmental degradation issues. Niger Delta's fragile contexts, where infrastructure is weak or non-existent, create special challenges for collecting reliable data, for example, the lack of statistics registries that measure the basic demographic information essential to planning when disasters happen. There are also enormous security problems involved in conducting research in such contexts. Almost no attention has been paid to rural communities, especially during the region's period of conflict and violence.

Participants during one of Community Feedback Meetings Lead by Professor Mrs. Ogisi
More than 250 women farmers empowered through capacity building in 10 pilot communities within the three ecological zones. Engaging women in the communities was a major challenge because traditionally women are not given space to speak. To allow the women to speak more comfortably, the team held informal group discussions and visited the spaces where women live and work. The team

also created Community-based Project Implementation Committees (CPICs) in each targeted community, drawing from existing functional social/community groups, to address daily activities. Two or three leaders of these social groups were nominated to form the CPICs (ensuring at least one woman per CPIC), which also included Local Government Areas (LGAs) representatives (mainly men). Through the CPIC, a group of 25 women farmers in each of the 10 pilot communities were trained on crop diversification/production, construction of flood control channels, different irrigation methods, the fencing of ponds and fish traps, and land assessment techniques. The CPICs were responsible for monitoring the trainings. The trained community groups were also supported by the LGAs with various farm inputs to put the learning into practice through small community-based pilot interventions championed by women farmers. These inputs included fertilizers, improved groundnut seedlings, early maturing crops, okra seedling, corn seedling in high quantities, pest resistant crops, and provision of improved cassava stems. Some women in the groups also ventured into livestock production. The direct involvement of the populations-at-risk through the CPICs facilitated the selection, implementation, and monitoring of community-based initiatives. The project deliberately and thoughtfully included the women farmers, benefiting both the project and the farmers and strengthening the farmer networks. The team understood that farmers do not manage risk based solely on climate, but also consider market conditions, flow, costs, revenue, etc., and adjusted their strategies accordingly. This understanding ensured successful communication between the women farmers and the LGA representatives.

Contribution from local government: new variety of seeds for
planting in Onichi-Ugbo community, Aniocha North, LGA, Delta state
Women's committees' networks created and recognized by local government units. Empowered by their participation in the study and trainings, women farmers from the 10 communities organized themselves into committees (supported by the Intervention Council for Women in Africa [ICWA]) to exchange information and explore options for managing climate risk and diversifying economic activities. These networks have also become the voice for women in these communities, doing the slow work of advocating for women's inclusion in decision making and their right to own farmland. They also used life-skill building and income diversification models to support and encourage women to make change in their communities. As a result of this work, more women are promoting on-farm diversification, and men have become more receptive to women owning land and participating in household decision making. In some cases, women have taken the lead in ensuring that crop diversification features prominently in their farming household climate-change adaptation strategies. Many women in the region use new kinds of seeds, plant a greater variety of crops, and have found planting early maturing crops that do not require a lot of water, particularly maize, productive. Through crop diversification, farming households are able to spread risk over a wider range of crops, reducing their vulnerability to extreme weather events. Some women also diversify their economic activities, raising both crops and livestock, opening hair salons or small stores, or doing food sales. If the women can sustain these activities, their household incomes and food security would increase, reducing their vulnerability to climate change and building their capacity for adaptation. The establishment of these networks have created a voice for women in their communities as they advocate for women's inclusion in matters beyond climate change. The local authorities now recognize the network as a channel to distribute subsidized farm inputs to farming households because staff of the local authorities are also members of the network. Again, subsidies have been an alternative form of agricultural risk sharing.

With access to subsidies and improved seedlings, the quantity of produce has increased, thereby reducing their vulnerability.

Ughelli Delta state: Women's committees' network
One governance permanent platform including women's groups embedded in existing decision-making organs strengthened under the chairmanship of the Delta State Commissioner for Environment. This project builds on over 10 years of collaboration between CPED and IDRC, the Delta State Ministry of Environment, Local Government Departments of Environment in the 10 target LGAs, civil-society organizations, and key government officials in the Niger Delta region in three areas: peace building (107272; 107476), global health (106948; 108080 TTI), and climate change (107761 TTI). This platform was formed over this long-term collaboration and reinforced through this project as a novel governance mechanism, bringing together State and Local authorities but also women's groups (which were not represented in previous projects) to promote ownership of the project by policymakers. Making policymakers part of the findings and policy recommendations ensures they can articulate and implement such recommendations. In the context of previous projects, the platform became the key organ to translate the findings into policies (e.g., a review of the Niger-Delta Development Commission Act and the Primary Health Care policy). The platform includes about 50 members, with women constituting at least $40 \%$. The members include the permanent secretary; directors in Delta State's ministries of environment; the chairs of the target LGAs; officials in charge of LGA's departments of agriculture and environment, health, and social development; ICWA and other women's groups; and project team representatives. Stakeholders were brought together several times over the life of the project for policy dialogue workshops, shared learning dialogues, public consultations, meetings, and training workshops. The platform enabled information exchange about priorities and needs and promoted collaborative decision making on, for instance, shared natural resources and risk management or crop diversification trainings. The members also reviewed and approved the study's research proposal and protocol before the study began and participated in all aspects of project implementation, so policymakers were informed of ongoing project activities and trainings. This kind of engagement was essential to the project. Because CPED is primarily focused on practitioners and decision makers, it excels at encouraging policymakers and other stakeholders to collaborate. In Nigeria, policymakers will rely on personal contacts with researchers they trust. Sustained and substantive communication engenders trust and CPED is extremely good at this. Ministry of Environment Delta State Government's long-term involvement with CPED, and as a direct research-process partner, creates the opportunity to influence policy, specifically in implementing the ongoing Delta State-climate-change policy process. The platform is now a permanent, dedicated, professional mechanism operating in the Delta State Ministry of Environment.

Policy dialogue workshop, Niger Delta, Feb 18th, 2020
As a result of Gender at Work support (RSP 108989), changes for gender equality were seen 1) in the team approach to carrying out research work, 2) among individual team members (junior and senior researchers), and 3) in their work with stakeholders across 10 communities. The support offered to CPED from Gender at Work (G@W; through expert mentoring, storytelling, free-writing, pair breakout groups, plenary discussions, and peer-learning) started with the IDRC-funded Think Thank Initiative (TTI) in 2009, which had already enhanced the capacities of the team to prioritize gender issues within their research portfolios and in their organizational development policies. Through this project, the direct support and dedication from the G@W associate Nkechi Odinukwe allowed them to implement a

--- Page 3 ---

gender transformative project. The team and the PO received crucial support in 1) understanding how each activity could move from gender sensitive and gender responsive to gender transformative through the development of strong monitoring and evaluation methods; 2) mentoring CPED field researchers and community facilitators to deliver training activities with the women farmers using feminist methodologies and to collectively explore how facilitators could introduce climate change issues to rural groups in an honest, non-technical, non-threatening manner. A key theme embedded in all exercises was the central role women play in climate-change adaptation and the need to include their voices in community conversations that affect their livelihoods. The goal was to make women leaders of community discussions on disaster preparedness and responses rather than just involved in such discussions, as would be the case in a gender responsive project. Since the CPED team is highly knowledgeable about climate-change science but less familiar with feminist methodologies that encourage safe and gender-friendly learning, the objective of the sessions was to introduce key ideas associated with gender, gender relations, power dynamics, gender vulnerability, and climate change in the context of the target communities. Sessions helped the team explore the possibility of redesigning some portions of their training to include more transformative approaches that promote participation among rural community groups. This work with CPED and in the 10 communities may not be considered transformative at its present stage, but I see a project that has been able to develop some level of critical consciousness in men in some, though not all, communities regarding gender relations, leading to an increased willingness on the part of these men make change in the public sphere. Overall, these achievements would not have been possible without the support from G@W.

If appropriate, explain why outputs were not completed or were of poor quality.
Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

Oftentimes, progress reports from CPED to IDRC were unclear, repetitive, and read like a draft, requiring more of the responsible officer's time. I had the impression that the team wanted to please IDRC by using our "buzz words" repetitively (such as "scale up" and "scale out") without always understanding their meaning. I decided to approve some of the reports in their draft form in consideration of the fact that all the content was included, and the research was scientifically sound, allowing the team to prioritize project implementation activities. However, despite huge challenges, for example COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and severe internet connectivity issues, CPED was extremely diligent in respecting the schedule of milestones and always delivered all the planned outputs following the approved workplan.

Interestingly, the research quality control system for all outputs (all open access) established by CPED during TTI, which relies on selected external academic reviewers, seems extremely efficient. All research outputs are compiled by the Research Coordinator and the Executive Director, who conducts a first quality check in his role as in-house editor before sending promising papers out to external reviewers. CPED's management and staff agree that this review process and the support from Research Associates have contributed to improving the institution's overall research.

# Project Outcomes 

How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area? Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

This research was important to fund because:
Despite the Niger Delta region's high vulnerability to climate change, extensive research on the causes of such vulnerability, particularly the vulnerability of women, does not exist. The research that does exist has inadequate scientific data and has focused on isolated issues of environmental degradation. Little attention has been paid to rural communities, especially during the extended period of conflict and violence. Rural inhabitants of the Niger Delta, especially women, are highly vulnerable to the degradation of socio-economic conditions, social conflict, and climate-related disaster events because of their reliance on natural resources for subsistence, limited access to education and climate information, and poverty and inequality. Women are less likely than men to be able to influence policy or to be formal decision-makers themselves, and are less likely to receive an education, own land, and have access to welfare, credit, or formal employment. Moreover, additional family responsibilities (i.e., caregiving and securing food, water, and energy for cooking, heating, etc.) limit women's mobility. In fact, women are central to adaptation processes because of the significant roles they play in informal and semiformal strategies related to water and land management (e.g., access, collection, and treatment), sanitation, agriculture, environmental protection, and caregiving. Empirical research and on-the-ground implementation and validation are needed to understand and support the specific role these practices play in improving disaster risk reduction strategies. Further studies are also required to examine the patriarchal constraints to roles of women and their empowerment options in household in the ecological zones of Niger Delta region.

A key component of supporting development in fragile contexts, especially in Africa, is promoting research that can provide the basis for development planning. IDRC's role is crucial here, as weak governments in these regions cannot fund research.

## Key select findings

Climate change and economic vulnerability of the household in Niger Delta region
The findings show that most of the respondents live in precarious conditions and are intrinsically vulnerable to any shocks that affect their agricultural systems. As with most of the rural Niger Delta region, the respondents live in rustic houses, lack electricity and running water, own few assets, and rely on natural ecosystems for drinking water, firewood, wild foods, and materials for household construction. Agriculture is their mainstay for livelihoods, serving both as the primary source of household food and principal means of income generation. Consequently, Niger Delta farmers and fishers are particularly vulnerable to any reductions in crop productivity for a variety of reasons. First, they cultivate very small parcels of land (less than two acres), dedicate most of their land to crop production for household consumption, and obtain low crop yields, insufficient to meet household needs let alone provide surplus for sale. These low and declining yields reflect the limited use of inputs (fertilizers, pesticides, improved seed varieties, etc.), the lack of animal traction, low technology practices, suboptimal land for production, the prevalence of slash and burn crop production, and land degradation-all of which have been identified as constraints to agricultural productivity not only in the Niger Delta region but in other parts of Africa.

--- Page 7 ---

The results show that a majority of the households in all three ecological zones are chronically food insecure, which makes them extremely vulnerable to any climate or non-climatic shocks that further reduce agricultural production and food availability. Even in normal years, as revealed during interviews and focus groups, three-quarters of the farming households across the Niger Delta region spend, on average, 3.8 months without sufficient food. Food pressure is most acute in the months immediately prior to the main harvest season. The lack of sufficient food has significant livelihood impacts, including increased rates of malnutrition and child mortality.

Another factor that increases the vulnerability of the households is the remoteness of the villages and lack of adequate road infrastructure. In rural communities across the three ecological zones, roads are in a poor state and unevenly distributed, with many villages lacking roads to connect them to other villages. Even the main roads are often accessible only during the dry season. The livelihood implications of this isolation are significant, as farmers and other primary producers have difficulties getting their products to markets. They also have difficulty obtaining agricultural inputs and have to pay higher prices for them, reducing their profit margins.

A final set of factors that exacerbate household vulnerability is that most households lack access to formal safety nets to which they could turn in times of need. Most of the smallholder farmers remain outside a formal credit or banking system, lack capital, and are unable to access credit or loans. With no formal financial institutions, farmers must rely on informal support systems, borrowing money or food from family or friends. In addition, although there are numerous local NGOs working in the three regions, there is no formal extension service and less than $10 \%$ of the farmers currently receive any technical support. Farmers also have limited access to agro-meteorological or market information that could help inform farm management decisions, such as the choice of crops, planting dates, and management strategies, and which could serve as early warning systems for floods, rainstorms, and windstorms.

Gender-based assessment of climate-change adaptation strategies in Delta State, Nigeria
The results showed that more men than women farmers were likely to adopt and effectively use most climate-change impact adaptation strategies. While more men than women fishers were likely to adopt adaptation strategies, significantly more women than men fishers effectively made use of some strategies. The results also revealed that women farmers/fishers were constrained by limited access to education and weather/climate information, lower incomes, a lack of control of the use of farmlands, and non-involvement in decision making. It was recommended that gendered initiatives such as access to farm inputs, climate information, and training, and the provision of alternative source of energy, climate smart agriculture tools, and credit facilities for women be embedded into government and private development agencies' adaptation planning processes.

The project revealed that a majority of the women arable crop farmers were within their active age range, married, literate, had a family size of seven, and farmed less than one hectare of land with very limited extension contacts. A majority of the farmers employed early planting, crop rotation, and minimum tillage as strategies to combat the challenges of climate change. Damage to crops due to serious rains and overflow of watercourse bank resulted in significant losses, with the highest climate-related loss reported at N926,000.00 annually. The results indicate that age, marital status, level of education, farming expertise, access to credit, and contact with extension agents were all statistically vital to women arable crop farmers' expenditure on custom-made measures against

--- Page 8 ---

climate-connected challenges. The main, longstanding constraint for the farmers was restricted accessibility to land for farming.

The results revealed that $37.9 \%$ and $25.4 \%$ of the women farmer respondents were affected by flooding and wildfire. A majority of the respondents ( $92.9 \%$ ) changed their planting date, $89.6 \%$ adopted early maturing varieties, while $77.9 \%$ and $82.5 \%$ adopted pest resistant varieties and diversification. There is a significant difference in the level of awareness of climate justice among male and female cassava farmers in the study area (P0.018< 0.05, P0.001<0.05). Effective agricultural policies and programs should focus on granting farmers access to early maturing cassava stem varieties and pest and flood resistant varieties.

Key results in term of changes to gender equality occurred across 10 communities, for instance:
In line with objective 2 of the project, the team successfully implemented training activities and established Community Project Implementation Committees (CPICs) in 10 communities within the Delta. As a result, about 100 men are supporting the inclusion of women's voices in the leadership structure of their communities.

Gender exercises that promote feminist methodologies and practices have been embedded in the CPED training guide for community trainings.

Women in some communities where the project was implemented have started stepping up to take leadership roles in their communities. The Project Manager of CPED and members of the training team shared that, prior to project intervention, women in the Uzere community were not included in key organs of decision making; however, after the first two months of building the capacity of select women and men community leaders on gender equality and equity, two women were invited to join the community development committee (CDC). As of January 2022, five women have become part of the CDC (a committee of 11 members) out of which two were nominated to leadership positions.

In January, 2022, 15 vulnerable women in Amajomata community (the majority of whom are widows) were allocated lands for farming purposes for which they did not have to pay.

Community men are gradually losing some of the negative cultural ideas and misconceptions they had about allowing women to lead climate-change adaptation. Mercy Omuero, a community facilitator, had this to say:

Since we started talking to women in the community about our training on climate change and gender equality, more women gradually volunteered to join our committee. Those men who were initially skeptical about the work we are doing, thinking we are advising or instigating the women especially wives against their husbands, have change their mind and are now involved in the advocacy work.

A network of gender advocates outside the organization was developed. Women farmers from the 10 communities organized themselves into committees (supported on the ground by ICWA and CPED).

Key results in term of changes for gender equality occurred regarding a team approach to carrying out research work, for instance:

The capacity of the wider CPED project staff has been strengthened around gender equality and feminist principles needed for climate change and other research projects. Ten project staff (three male and six female community trainers and one female administrative staff) have increased their

--- Page 9 ---

understanding of how gender is linked to climate change.
CPED can best determine their own gender research priorities based on their knowledge of the local landscape (e.g., they are now working to ensure gender is a crosscutting issue in all of their research proposals).

Community facilitators have become more confident and skillful at facilitating open, honest, and sometimes difficult conversations with community leaders around the unequal gender norms that perpetrate inequality. A clear example is offered by a male trainer working in the community of Ethiope East LGA:

We observed that when we initially brought up the issue of gender and started talking about it, there was a kind of resistance from men. But when we brought out the equality form of gender and told them about what the women were facing, we then noticed a paradigm shift in their attitude. It was just a diagram that we used but, somehow, using that diagram to illustrate a point helped men shift their thinking. Once we noticed the men were willing to engage, we split the participants into same sex groups and asked women how they would like to be supported in the area of climate change by their men, and women wrote them down. We also asked men how they would like to support their women and they wrote surprising points on how they can support their wives. These points shared by men showed that men will be ready to shift ground.

The team has become more open to discussing the challenges they face around implementing the project in a gender responsive way. This has helped make group reflections and learning more interactive.

The level of trust between G@W and the team has increased because of the consistent effort made to sustain a safe space for reflection despite COVID restrictions and internet challenges.

The regular communication structure that enables IDRC and G@W to interact virtually with the team to share experiences and discuss the program has helped sustain the learning relationship in-between community trainings.

Key results in term of changes for gender equality occurred at the individual level among team members, for instance:

Team members have increased confidence to engage with gender and apply it to their work (use a gender lens in research processes).

Team members have increased their understanding of integrating a gender perspective in monitoring and evaluation processes.

Team members have increased their general knowledge of gender and gender concepts, including thinking about differences between gender sensitive/responsive and gender transformative research.

Team members are now more mindful of how they handle target audience and community peculiarities as they bring a gender lens to the way they facilitate trainings. In the words of a community trainer:

I try to know the minds of both sexes. I try to bring in gender sensitivity - to carry along both sexes. If I advocate that those men and woman should be treated equally, it is important for me to reflect on my behavior and communication with them. I now try to break the ice with participants using playful exercises that gets the atmosphere friendly in order to remove the timidity from people before I start

--- Page 10 ---

training. These approaches have helped make learning a lot more effective for everyone.
Team members have become more gender aware and conscious in the way they embed feminist/gender transformative language in discussions, proposals, and trainings. For instance, during the project's period, CPED received a grant from the United States Institute of Peace (USIP): Promoting Community-embedded youth peace building and conflict mitigation in Nigeria's Niger Delta region. One of the key research questions was: What are the roots causes and drivers of Niger Delta conflicts, the role of youth, the importance of social and gender inequalities and peace building experiences in the region? The capacity building CPED received through IDRC over the past 10 years, including with G@W, hugely influenced the selection of this proposal.

The knowledge and skills of team members has been enhanced in a way that will promote change processes in communities. Some clear examples of how the process has strengthened the capacity of team members are seen in Mercy's quote:

On gender, before this project I had little or no knowledge about gender. The concept was new to me. However, during implementing the project, I have been able to get a clear understanding of the concept of sex and gender, how socialization plays a very important role in gender inequality issues. I now know that all what is referred to as gender today is determined by people. It means that if people determine these ideologies, these same people can bring about the needed change. If the mind sets of people are changed, then things can change in a particular location. Before now I used to see gender equality as something meant to favor only the women, but I now see it as something that seeks to correct the inequalities between men and women. It brings about development and is helpful.

Newer members of the facilitation team have become more confident at using feminist facilitation processes for gender and climate-change trainings in communities, as seen in Iroro's quote:

On what has changed about the way I facilitate trainings in communities since the climate change project started, I can say that a lot has indeed changed. I know I am bold now - I can face any community group and not feel intimidated by age of members or other issues. I have also learned how to use a lot of lively exercises to bring community learners into the learning and make them feel comfortable. They no longer see us as a lecturers or teachers but as co-learners. There are so many things that keep us busy, and time is never enough. We give people time now to air their views and the gender exercises helps us not to always train directly from modules. Sometimes we act dramas now. We make learning more playful and curious. People laugh a lot now in our trainings. We used illustrations a lot and allowed participants to discover solutions for themselves. The reflection sessions with G@W helped me a lot to pick up some of these skills and ideas.

Individual team members have already started thinking about how they can role model some of the feminist principles they are picking up. According to Osagie, a community trainer and project mentee:

One of the things that has happened to me because of some of my learning from this work is that I am now being responsible as a human being. Though this is not the first time I am getting this training on gender. I now see myself doing things women do. I bath my boy. I cook when my wife does not have time. I feed the boy. I sweep the compound. The aspect of being gender responsible because change has to come from me before the others can change is what I live with every day. I try to remove all stereotypes around house chores because my father would never do any house chores. My mother still washes his clothes. That is the social norm that exists in my community but now, nobody tells me how

--- Page 11 ---

to take care of my family. When you know what is right, you do it. I am still developing and evolving, and I believe that one day I will be on podium speaking as a champion for gender equality on the global stage.

What helped the above changes?
The Primary Investigator's non-interference in project implementation and observed commitments to keeping the organization's learning space open and safe for all team members.

G@W's non-intrusive methodologies, which strengthen the team's work with communities and encourages trust-building among learners.

The team's enthusiasm and willingness to explore new and unconventional ways of thinking and doing their work.

The team was careful not to add to women's burdens instead of empowering them.
What hindered the above Change?
The COVID-19 pandemic social distancing restrictions.
Poor internet connectivity made online discussions very challenging. Some core team members live in remote locations that have very poor internet access.

How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way? Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

An unintended outcome was the results generated by the project on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on local food production and informal food markets in Nigeria, with Niger

Delta region as case study (under CRFS COVID and Food systems stream 1). The team carried out a survey of 2,000 farmers (comprising 600 food producers, 600 food marketers, and 800 households) and found that disruptions to supplier and produce logistics, volatile markets, and financial measures arising from government responses to the COVID-19 outbreak had a significant impact on producers, greatly reducing profits and increasing the likelihood of a net loss in the first half of 2021. Coping strategies included adjusting stock management practices, finding new markets, and borrowing money. The results have been well summarized in these three policy briefs:

of Women and Girls" (108870), launched March 8, 2018. It is one of seven projects selected from 499 proposals via a review process involving external experts and IDRC staff.

Invest in knowledge for positive changes
On a local scale, the knowledge generated by the project guided the pilot intervention activities in the testing and implementation of community-based adaptation initiatives championed by women farmers and carried out in 10 rural target communities. At the regional scale, the project-generated knowledge contributed to informing the Delta State Government Climate Change Policy through the platform embedded in existing decision-making organs, though the process was interrupted during the pandemic. This policy is expected to guide local and national positive social- and spatial-management developments and benefit thirty million people, especially high-risk populations like women and children.

Regarding the CC program's priorities, the project contributed to effective, climate action that reduces social inequality, strengthens climate resilience, and improves the livelihoods of the most vulnerable developing world communities in fragile contexts. The project conducted policy-relevant action research for more resilient communities and connected solutions with actors who can help advance those solutions (A\&E; Implementation Plan).

Build the leaders for today and tomorrow
The project provided funds to support two master's students from Nigerian Universities and mentored ten junior researchers and five field-research assistants who gained applied skills and knowledge in research and practice (see outcomes above). The project also enhanced the capacity of seven CPED core project-management and knowledge-translation staff. Furthermore, the project trained 25 key stakeholders (e.g., key government officials and professionals) from the Delta State and local governments, 250 women community farmers, and 50 representatives of community-based organizations to build their capacities to understand gender challenges and opportunities and identify and test effective and affordable adaptation strategies.

Comment: The COVID-19 pandemic made implementing activities during Year 3 of the project extremely difficult and the scale up impossible, and policy dialogue events had to be cancelled. In fact, there was confusion regarding the use of terminology such as "scale out," "scale up," etc., and a clear misunderstanding among the partners. During the final workshop, the team identified this as probably the most challenging aspect of the project. The fact that this objective was rewritten and imposed by IDRC's PL created confusion. The PO anticipated, even before the pandemic, that generated research results/knowledge and pilot intervention activities may not be implemented and scaled up by public agency policy and planning despite key stakeholders being engaged early in the project's design and implementation process. This was identified as a risk.

Specific Objective 5: Inform the Delta State Executive and Legislature of women-led community-based adaptation strategies.

Financial performance
Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

The risk level of the Centre for Population and Environmental Development (CPED) was reduced from high to medium by the Regional Controller following a review of the overall performance of this institution. In fact, several potential risks related to governance problems (e.g., leadership transition) and financial management inefficiencies were effectively managed and greatly reduced during the TTI project's Phase 2. Nevertheless, CPED must continue to improve its financial management system, especially by recruiting an experienced Administrative and Finance Officer (AFO). Currently, although the CPED's financial reporting was generally timely and detailed, the Executive Director and key Program Officer are doing most of the work of the Centre's Accountant, who is supposed to be

--- Page 14 ---

responsible for financial management and reporting. They are now in the process of hiring a new AFO.
The Executive Director seems apprehensive of the potential challenges of welcoming a proficient AFO (and non-researcher) into a research environment. In addition to the concern that a purely professional AFO might negatively affect the efficient management of research activities, the Executive Director fears that the cost of recruiting and maintaining such a qualified administrative staff member would further constrain the institution's current financial situation. I had nevertheless encouraged CPED Management to take the necessary bold steps to strengthen organizational performance.

The CPED always began the implementation of its research work ahead of receiving IDRC instalment. Furthermore, contrary to other West African grantee institutions, which often requested payment of a portion of the hold back amount related to their previous grant (usually disbursed only after the successful completion of the traditional IDRC-funded project), CPED was able to pre-finance all the project activities. These two facts show that the CPED's financial situation is relatively strong, and that the institution is making demonstrable progress towards institutional sustainability.

# Strategic Considerations 

Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

Unanticipated risks that affected the project were:
The COVID-19 pandemic made implementing activities difficult in Year 3 of the project. This was especially due to the restriction of movements and ban on gathering in person and holding face-to face meetings with policymakers. Consequently, planned activities had to be reorganized and reconsidered. The project team took time to adjust to the new normal in engaging key stakeholders following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic as most of the senior researchers struggled to learn the new technologies for engaging in virtual meetings, group calls, and attending dialogues via video conferencing. The already huge connectivity issue in the Delta did not help the situation. Finally, COVID-19 brought into focus CPED's limited ability to facilitate interactions virtually among team members and between them and other stakeholders. While CPED was able to respond to this technological challenge by improving its facilities for virtual meetings and workshops, more improvements will be needed as COVID-19 is likely to continue to influence the mode of interactions with researchers and other stakeholders for years to come.

One challenge the institution had started to address are the preparations needed to ensure a smooth transition when the current Executive Director and founder of the CPED retires. The ED originally planned to retire in 2021, but will now retire this year, 2022. A successful leadership transition is critical to the CPED if it is to achieve its long-term objective of becoming a sustainable, policy-relevant, and action-research-oriented institution that aims to increase Nigerian policymakers' evidence-based knowledge and contribute to sustainable development across the country.

Recommendations from the PO while travelling to the Niger Delta:
Plan for more time then is allowed in an "IDRC trip request" to travel from Lagos to the Delta (Benin city): Plan two days to go and two days to come back, even if this is only a two-hour domestic flight. Schedule is completely unpredictable.

--- Page 15 ---

While travelling to the Niger Delta, hire a security escort from a private company for transit through high-risk areas. These security escorts can also offer ground transportation while in location. All international organizations I met, both private and public bodies, use private companies for security while travelling in the Delta.

POs should book domestic air transport and ground transportation ourselves or through our partners if possible (for peace of mind and more efficiency). IDRC travel agency made numerous errors for the domestic flights.

Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

The research proposal and survey instruments were presented to the University of Benin Ethical Committee, the nationally recognized body for ethical approval in Delta State that is primarily covered by field survey activities in the project. Following the approval of the research protocol by the University, the Ministry of Environment wrote letters of permission to conduct the study to the key stakeholders in the 10 target LGAs, thus mobilizing preparations for the detailed field surveys. The project team then relocated to the 10 target LGAs to carry out project activities in full cooperation with all stakeholders involved.

Cultural constraints included a risk that women might be reluctant to hold open meetings with men, especially in the context of the Niger Delta region where women have faced years of violence. This risk was handled very carefully by ensuring efforts were made in rural communities to organize separate meetings for men and women and to ensure women were free to express views on issues affecting them. Risk of gender-based violence against women participants was curtailed by ensuring the project was understood by traditional leaders, elders, and men in target communities. Finally, all the community facilitators were from the Niger Delta, and this was crucial for thrust and to engage members in meaningful dialogue about the context and the issue or problem around which they are facilitating.

# Director comments 

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

The PO has presented a very detailed PCR for the Niger Delta Project. From the five project highlights presented by Melanie, the integration of women's empowerment and research in highly fragile regions is remarkable. The connection between Climate Change, gender inequalities and conflict is one of the most under-resourced research agendas in the climate action space. This PCR proves the impact and importance of this kind of intervention.

The support of the PO to the grantees has proven worth the investment. The number of publications, policy documents, tools, training materials, etc., is outstanding. Despite documenting progress and following some of the IDRC, the process was not always at the level required.

I want to congratulate the PO and the rest of the IDRC team on supporting a project that, while not easy to implement, has provided an impact on communities beyond the expected results.
