# Project Highlights 

What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

Insights about women farmers in rural Ghana: Factors that influence women's participation in Farmer Based Organizations (FBOs) were identified at the beginning of the project. Findings indicated that only 20 to $30 \%$ of women had a bank account in the previous year while only $30 \%$ to $55 \%$ of women had autonomy for their income and crop production decisions. There were no differences between members of FBO and non-members. An analaysis of findings from earlier studies indicated that womens' exposure and participation levels in nutrition-sensitive interventions were essential to maximize children's dietary and anthropometric outcomes. These key findings helpd shape the design of the project interventions.

Gender transformative approaches. The project addressed a critical structural gender based financial barrier for women agripreneurs in terms of access to resources. The issue was around high interest rates charged on microcredit loans for those who did not have previous loan record, mostly women. Project negotiations with a collaborating rural bank resulted in reduced interest rates for project participants based on certain criteria. Following successful intervention actitivities and more than 90\% loan repayment rate by the participaing women resulted in the bank to change policies that favored more opportunities to do business with women enterpreneurs thereby removing the gender-related barrier to credit access identified at baselin. Additionally, this successful model motivated other credit institutions in the district to be interested in working with the project communities as well as extending to new beneficiaries.

Another gender related finding was that being a member of FBOs (the intervention groups) was associated with greater empowerment. For example, higher crude empowerment scores (measured through Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index) pointed to a higher likelihood of both women and men being empowered with a better possibility to establish gender equity in the household.

Income generation: The study resulted in significant income gains for participating women agripreneurs. During the two years of intervention period, 132 women who focused on poultry sold over 1.8 million poultry eggs with an approximate value of $\sim$ US $\$ 180,000$ (based on a value of US $\$ 3$ per a crate of 30 eggs) in the local and regional markets. Another 33 women who cultivated eggplants sold over $62,000 \mathrm{Kg}$ of the vegetable at a value $\sim$ US $\$ 124,000$ (based on a value of US $\$ 2$ per kilo) and made profits because of their ability to produce and sell the vegetable when the market supply was low. The project thus stimulated an overall increase in annual income of about US\$300,000 for 165 women, each with an average US\$1800/. In addition, this contributed to market access for high-quality animal source food product (eggs) and off-season locally grown vegetables (eggplants).

Nutrition-sensitive pathways: Project intervention packages supported nutrition-sensitive activities through three key pathways: (i) food production (through poultry and eggplant gardening) to contribute to a diversified diet; (ii) income generation (with nutrition education), to access diverse, nutrient-rich foods in the marketplace, and (iii) women's empowerment to make choices in favor of improved food security. Reseachers collected and analyzed data to better understand the impacts of nutrition-sensitive pathways with interesting insights:

--- Page 1 ---

Results from dietary intake data at the baseline and endline showed that the diet quality scores moved in a positive direction for the intervention group (from a mean diversity score of $4.8 \pm 1.5$ to $5.2 \pm 1.2$; $P=0.03$ ) comapred to comparison group.

Assessment of differences in food security levels (i.e. food secure or food insecure at mild level or moderate level or severe level) between internvention and comparions households showed that almost one-half (46\%) of intervention households improved in their food security status compared to only 36\% of comparison households.

When Food Insecurity levels were examined in relation to household empowerment scores (assessed using the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index), results showed that empowered households had a lower odds of being food insecure while the opposite was true for access to financial services (that is participants with higher empowerment scores had better chanaces to access credit).

These are important results that supports the benefits of nutrition-sensitive interventions while also pointing to the complexity and longer term nature of the system level changes. The research also revealed the need for intentional incorporation of nutrition education in the interventions.

Policy contribution through local participation: With sustainability as its core goal, the project's engagements with district and municipal-level institutions in the planning, design, and implementation of the intervention packages led to mutual learnings. This helped both the researchers and the local institutions to explore new policy directions and intervention strategies. This also helped to ensure that the voices of the community were integrated in the process to identify suitable solutions. The iterative process in planning the interventions enabled the local institutions to identify possible synergies with other on-going national programs (for example, the Modernizing Agriculture in Ghana programme which is a partnership initiative between the Governments of Ghana and Canada).

Project Outcomes
4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

The research was important to fund because ending hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition 'in all its forms', and improving sustainable agriculture remain central to the global development agenda. To scale up any successful intervention, there is a need to understand why interventions do or do not work. In addition, there is a gap in understanding of factors that influence stakeholder participation in intervention activities. More specifically, the project contributed to the limited number of studies that examined the role of women's participation in farmer groups on empowerment (of both women and men), as well as the possible linkages between empowerment and indicators related to agriculture and nutrition in the African context.

The project also successfully tested co-creation of knowledge with project beneficiaries which shed light on why some entrepreneurs succeed while others fail given the same opportunities. Using an interesting case study approach, the study participants themselves identified strategies that successful women among them utilized to thrive as farmers and businesswomen. They also identified the challenges that 'least' successful women experienced. For example, findings showed that:
successful women entrepreneurs applied the knowledge they gained through financial and agricultural training to manage their farming and trading capital, avoided impulsive spending, and found ways to save money. They also had plans for self-investment to continue their enterprises after the intervention whereas 'less successful' woman expressed expectation for continued project support.

--- Page 3 ---

being successful resulted in higher self-esteem and empowerment through more participation in decision making at home, and recognition among peers in the community.

Key findings related to scaling suggest that Farmer Based Organizations in Ghana were important tools to promote gender and nutrition-sensitive agriculture interventions. It is also necessary to intentionally incorporate nutrition education and context specific women's empowerment measures into programs that promote improved incomes and agriculture productivity if the goal is also to achieve improved diet/nutrition related outcomes.

An unexpected finding from the nutrition surveys showed that about $43 \%$ of the rural women in the project location were either overweight or obese compared to $16 \%$ of their male household members. Somewhat surprisingly, qualitative data suggested that most of the women did not recognize overweight and obesity as health concerns. Representatives from Ghana Health Services indicated that the project's findings about the high overweight levels in the communities were 'eye opening'. This demographic trend i.e. a shift from the usual undernutrition related problems in Africa to the overweight/obesity related issues is in line with the triple burden of malnutrition, a sweeping trend across the developing countries. These findings gave the project team's nutrition experts an opportunity to develop relevant messages as part of the institutional capacity strengthening activities.

How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?
Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

Overall, the project evolved as planned. During the course of the project, the research team was able to measure positive change at the production, income and food purchase levels. They also identified encouraging positive trends in food security and dietary diversity attributed to nutrition-sensitive pathways.

The project successfully adapted and made adjustments to address several unexpected developments, but they also faced challenges that couldn't be addressed within the time frame. For example,

Government banned importations, a COVID-19 measure, resulted in a market shortage of poultry equipment, vaccines, and feed. To resolve this the project used innovative ways in discussion with the stakeholders. A COVID-19 relief fund received by Heifer Ghana was used to purchase supplies for poultry enterprises and provide them to project women farmers at a $50 \%$ subsidy. While the subsidy enabled the women to continue making a small profit from their poultry work, the returns generated from the sale of the supplies was added into a group account which served as a revolving fund for the group.

COVID-19 restrictions also interrupted efforts to collaborate with the government health department to address issues identified in baseline surveys with respect to dietary diversity and women's health. The project tried mobile phone messaging as one potential avenue to reach women with behaviour change communication, but poor cell phone network made this approach much more challenging than expected.

Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy.
Provide specific numbers where possible.
This study was developed and implemented as part of the IDRC's 2015-2020 strategic plan. It contributed to the following strategic objectives:

Invest in knowledge and innovation for large-scale positive change
The project contributed to a better knowledge on designing and implementing nutrition-sensitive and gender transformative food systems programming through three key pathways - agriculture production, income generation and women's empowerment. The study demonstrated impacts through significant positive changes for the families of 165 participating women who gained an additional average annual income of US\$1800, while contributing to increased availability of animal source foods ( 1.8 million poultry eggs) and locally grown fresh vegetables ( $62,000 \mathrm{kgs}$ ) to the local and regional markets.

Build the leaders for today and tomorrow
The research activities provided interdisciplinary research and training opportunities for a Ph.D. student from McGill University, four master's students from University of Ghana and several local young women as research assistants who continue to contribute to the Nutrition Research and Training Center located in rural Ghana (Asesewa). Notably, the Ph.D. candidate from McGill University (Diana Dallmann) received an Emerging Leader award at the Nutrition Live Online 2021 conference for her presentation on the project's nutrition sensitive agriculture interventions. The project also provided collaboration and field study opportunities to other young researchers including recipients of the Queen Elizabeth Scholarship, students from the University of Ghana's Business School, Regional Institute for Population Studies, School of Public Health, and McGill Mastercard Foundation Scholars (undergraduate and master's level students) interested in building their research capacity.

In addition, the project contributed to IDRC 2030 Strategic objective on Share knowledge for Greater Uptake and Use. For example:

The project team was invited by the local Department of Agriculture to a multi-stakeholder planning meeting to brainstorm solutions for critical problems affecting farmers and agriculture in the municipality. This facilitated sharing of knowledge generated through the project which subsequently led to one of the Government departments adopting the project's loan concept to pilot a poultry intervention in a new community using the institution's own funds.

The Business Advisory Committee of the National Board for Small Scale Industries engaged with project's women farmers and facilitated their application for governmental relief credit aimed to mitigate the negative effects of COVID-19 on small and medium enterprises.

At the global level, project researchers synthesized and communicated results on the topic of the nutrition-sensitive agriculture intervention and women's empowerment through several high-impact scientific papers (publications identified in the research outputs section of the PCR).

Comment: COVID-19 related travel restrictions and prolonged closure of government offices impeded the integration of the effective and successful approaches tested through the project into permanent district and local level programs. Some local government officials, even when they indicated interest to integrate lessons from the project into their permanent programs, brought up issues around lack of funds as a barrier. These issues need further consideration for future programming.

## Financial performance

Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

Overall, the project was implemented efficiently from the grant management perspective. A few points to note:

A no-cost time extension for 12 months was requested and approved. This additional time helped the researchers to continue activities disrupted during the lockdowns and to complete the intervention period necessary to measure different indicators at the endline.

As a direct impact of the global pandemic, Heifer International, one of the three project grantees, closed its country operations in Ghana and hence could not continue as a project partner during the extension period. However, Heifer International delivered its commitments till the end of the original project period and did everything needed for a smooth transition including transfer of key field personnel to continue project activities under the University of Ghana.

--- Page 6 ---

To facilitate continuity of project activities without disruption, IDRC Grant Administration team worked closely with the responsible Program Officer and the grantees which helped to ensure timely recovery of unused funds from Heifer International and issue of a supplement to the University of Ghana, all within the overall grant budget following the Center processes.

# Strategic Considerations 

Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

The risk of currency fluctuations due to the project budget being in three different currencies identified in the PAD did not impact the project activities financially, partly because the value of local currency (Ghanaian Cedi) remained low or dropped considerably during the course of the project.

Other than the unexpected COVID-19 related risks that delayed the project activities by almost one year and hindered the research results being fully integrated into local permanent programs, the project team proactively implemented risk mitigation strategies identified at the beginning of the project. Frequent interactions between the researchers and the responsible PO during the pandemic proved useful in the absence of monitoring visits to the field sites.

The internal capacity strengthening activities and project review meetings were moved to online due to the inability for the researchers from McGill University to travel to Ghana to participate in surveys and events.

Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

The project research involved human subjects which included consumer studies and dietary data collection. The experience of senior faculty from the Nutrition Departments of the University of Ghana and McGill University in conducting field studies adhering to international ethics protocols ensured that all the necessary procedures were followed. Accordingly, detailed protocols were prepared for each study and formal ethics approvals obtained both in Canada and Ghana. Written informed consent was obtained from relevant participants in all data collection processes.

Program Leader / Manager comments
Program Leaders/Managers should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

Director comments
The relevant Program or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

It is essential to highlight how the participating women's successful intervention activities with more than $90 \%$ loan repayment rate resulted in the bank changing policies. These policies favoured more opportunities to do business with women entrepreneurs, thereby removing the gender-related barrier to

credit access identified at baseline.
The project proved that to scale up any successful intervention, there is a need to understand why approaches do or do not work. In addition, we need to understand the factors influencing stakeholder participation in the activities. The project team also produced many scientific and technical publications discussing the success and best practices of gender transformative interventions.

Frequent interactions between the researchers and the responsible PO during the pandemic proved helpful. The PO was critical in supporting the rationale for the one-year extension approved. This commitment allowed the finalization of the project to achieve all goals. It is essential to remember that the project's success is also largely due to the PO's work.
