| --- |
|  Crop yields in Africa have fallen over the years leading to a decline in per capita food production. There is a global consensus that unless urgent action is taken, this situation will be aggravated by climate variability and change. However, adaptation to climate change is information-intensive, and farmers in Africa lack access to climate information in user-friendly formats and within an acceptable lead time to enable them to make informed decisions to minimize losses and maximize the opportunities presented by climate variability and change. This project aimed to bridge this gap.  |
|  Started in June 2018, this project aimed to increase resilience of smallholder farmers in Kenya and Uganda by increasing access to climate change adaptation information using information and communication technology (ICT)-based platforms. In Kenya, the project was implemented in Machakos, Makueni and Kitui Counties. In Uganda, the implementation sites included Nakasongola, Sembabule, Soroti, and Rakai districts.  |
|  In Kenya, the project developed and disseminated weather-based agro-advisories using local FM radio stations, agricultural extension staff, farmer meetings and pamphlets for the March-April-May and October-November-December seasons. The project established and provided ongoing support to seven Climate Field Schools to diffuse the adoption of improved agronomic practices. A significant impact from this project is that the three Counties of Machakos, Makueni and Kitui have embraced the agro-advisory service and have developed Climate Information Service Plans to institutionalize and finance the service.  |
|  In Uganda, the project disseminated seasonal, 1-month and 10-day weather forecasts and agricultural advisories to smallholder farmers using FM radio broadcasts, SMS, email, and face-to-face farmers meetings with extension agents for March-April-May and September-October-November-December seasons throughout the project period.  |

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC·CRDI

The project conducted a study to determine the yield and profitability of different adaptation options for promotion in the drought-prone cattle corridor area.

The project supported four graduate students: two graduated and have since enrolled for PhD programs, one has submitted their Masters Thesis for examination while another one was finalizing their Master Thesis. The project published four papers in peer reviewed journals and three more manuscripts are under preparation. The project was able to implement the proposed activities and achieve its objectives.

# PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

1. In Kenya, this project has significantly contributed toward the institutionalisation and long term financing of agro-advisory services for farmers via Climate Information Service Plans in the Counties of Machakos, Makueni and Kitui, which the project team directly contributed toward. This is a significant achievement that promises long term impacts from this project, and greater climate resilience for farmers in these three counties.
2. Linked to the above impact, most farmers in the three Counties of Machakos, Makueni and Kitui in Kenya are now using weather-based agro-advisories to plan their farm operations and are able to realize good yields of maize, pigeon pea, beans, green gram and cowpea among other crops, even when the season is marginal. This has reduced dependency on relief food supplies by the Government and aid agencies.
3. In Uganda, most of the farmers in the implementation districts adopted weather-based advisories and adaptation options demonstrated in field sites. The project found that the different Climate Smart Agriculture practices including planting date, intercropping, fertilizer use and varieties of maize and beans were adopted by farmers and showed higher profitability. Farmers appreciated the different interventions, with majority committing to adopt more than two of the climate smart agriculture options demonstrated.
4. The project supported four graduate students: two graduated and have since enrolled for PhD programs, one has submitted their Masters Thesis for examination while another one was finalizing their Master Thesis.
5. The project published four papers in peer reviewed journals and three more manuscripts are under preparation. Already available papers (listed in the section below) shed light on the uptake of agro-advisory services among farmers and the adoption and acceptability of climate smart agriculture practices, thereby contributing toward the literature in this area and moving this field of study forward.

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

This project aimed to understand how to scale an information and communication technology (ICT)-mediated climate information dissemination tool that was originally developed and piloted by an IDRC funded Climate Change Adaptation and ICT (CHAI) project in Uganda during 2012-2017. The tool leverages the use of mobile phones and traditional technologies such as FM radio transmissions. The challenge addressed in this project was how to scale up the CHAI model and create impact beyond local study sites. This project has addressed this challenge through field studies in Uganda and Kenya, with the goal of identifying pathways for scaling up climate adaptation services for greater impact. Toward this end, the project has produced a rich body of knowledge that unpacks the barriers and opportunities for farmers to make use of agro-advisory services and climate smart agriculture, and indeed has not only identified institutional mechanisms for this, but succeeded in having this institutionalised an funded long term in Kenya. This concrete impact is a significant outcome from this project, and one that can serve as a model for other countries on the continent.

5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

In large part, this study achieved the results that were intended in all but one area. While the project has made significant head-way in understanding how agro-advisories and climate smart agriculture can be pursued and institutionalised in Kenya and Uganda, the study failed to bring these lessons together in order to reach generalised or synthetic conclusions that could be applied beyond these contexts. In other words, the study evolved as essentially two parallel studies, one in each country, and failed to synthesise its findings. Two factors contributed toward this. First was the project design. The Kenyan and Ugandan teams had different methodologies, and while the Kenyan team focused on the information and communication technology (ICT) dimensions and assessing farmer use and uptake of these, the Ugandan team focussed more on climate smart agriculture and the responses of specific crops to different treatments. Both were valuable studies, but they failed to be brought together into one set of recommendations to scale up ICT-mediated climate information, as intended. A second factor was the COVID-19 Pandemic which significantly impacted the ability of project teams to interact during a critical period of this project (2020-2021). The health of one of the Principal Investigators also deteriorated significantly during the course of 2021, combined with personal family loss, resulting in less opportunities for cross-project synthesis and learning. These shortfalls are however assessed as insignificant given the contributions and the impact of this project despite the challenges encountered.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.

Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy.

Provide specific numbers where possible.

Through testing of information and communication technology (ICT) and climate smart agriculture, this study has contributed toward IDRC's objective of investing in high-quality research and innovation in developing countries. With its focus on ICT's, the study also contributed toward IDRC's objective to share knowledge for uptake and use.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC·CRDI

The project received a 1 year no-cost extension in 2020 and finished with an underspend of 11% of the budget. The implementation of this project was impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic, and the no-cost extension was granted because the research design was one that relied on monitoring the impacts of the project interventions during two full growing seasons. Fieldwork was necessary in order for the students supported through this project to complete their theses and graduate with a masters degree. Despite this accommodation, this project displayed significant delinquency in technical and financial reporting, which contributed to the underspend, since IDRC had no way to be aware of this until the final reports were received. Indeed, their final technical and financial reports were received roughly 8 months late. The Program Officer and the Grant Officer took significant steps to secure these reports. Eventually a formal letter explaining that funds would need to be returned should the reports not be received shortly resulted in these reports being received. Apart from the poor health of one individual, the only other explanation was the apparent division of labour between this team, with one organisation in the partnership being responsible for the technical reporting and another for the financial reporting. This kind of arrangement should be avoided in future. By the time the 11% underspend came to IDRC's attention, it was not considered a useful investment to keep this project open to allow the team to spend these funds, and a request for a second extension was denied.

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

A key risk identified in the project approval document was the potential for the Kenyan component to be slow to take off compared to Uganda, and the possibility that neither component (Kenya or Uganda) would be able to institutionalise the model and achieve sustainability beyond IDRC support. Significant effort was put into ensuring that the risks in Kenya, in particular, were dealt with and indeed this bore fruit, with the Kenyan team being highly successful in both publications and getting the project innovation (information and communication technology, ICT) institutionalised in that country. The Ugandan team, by contrast, ended up with an almost purely research-based study, with little tangible long term impact on policy. It is the program Officer's impression that this resulted from a breakdown in the relationship between the partners over time, exacerbated by COVID-19 and their inability to meet face to face. These circumstances contributed toward a narrowing of the ambition of the Ugandan team. The risk of the partnership being weak was not foreseen at the outset of the project. The responsible officer for this project changed twice, in 2019 and 2020 respectively, and this change over may also have contributed toward this rift between partner's and the lack of a common vision not being noticed and acted upon early enough.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

As presented in this PCR the "Scaling-Up Pathways of Last Mile Climate Information Services for Community Resilience in Uganda and Kenya" project supported smallholder farmers by providing climate change adaptation information. It used technology to deliver weather-based agro-advisories and agricultural advisories to help farmers make informed decisions and improve their farming practices. This approach plays a vital role in assisting smallholder farmers in enhancing their resilience to climate change. The project is an illustration of CRFS's programmatic priorities by offering practical solutions to farmers. However, there is limited clarity on how the project team incorporated gender equality approaches into the research implementation.

The project successfully conducted field studies, identified pathways for scaling up climate adaptation services, and addressed barriers and opportunities for farmers. In Kenya, it institutionalized and secured long-term funding for agro-advisory services and climate-smart agriculture. Despite the breakdown in partnerships in Uganda and challenges caused by COVID-19 the teams could still have some, while limited, impact on policy.

As described by the PO, the project's success demonstrates its potential as a model for other African countries. This is a good example of the importance of strong partnerships, effective communication, continuous collaboration, and consistent project leadership for successful implementation.
