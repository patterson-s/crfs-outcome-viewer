## Project Abstract

Food systems in Latin America are increasingly associated with unhealthy and unsustainable outcomes. The region contributes to almost 10% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) global emissions, mostly from the energy sector, agriculture and land use change. The latter two account for 56% of total GHGs in the region, compared to the global average of 22%. With the highest rates of overweight and obesity in the world coexisting with persistent undernutrition and climate change it is a region emblematic at the global syndemic. Yet, Latin America is also a region with relevant experiences with leading policies and actions aligned with healthy and sustainable food systems. In parallel to the Rockefeller Foundation (RF) and the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) partnership work on healthy and sustainable food systems in East Africa, Wellcome and IDRC will support the development of an agenda for action for a transition to a health-promoting and climate friendly food system in Latin America, with a focus on policies and actions to deliver both health and environment objectives. A multidisciplinary coalition of experienced researchers across the region will review the evidence on how to accelerate the transition to healthy sustainable food systems that prioritize access to healthy affordable diets, while keeping GHGs emissions within sustainable limits. They will analyze the underlying political economy that may prevent or enable rapid action. Expected outcomes include a collective agenda for advocacy and action on healthy sustainable food systems developed in concert with identified allies and with a focus in regional experiences, particularly from Argentina, Brazil and Chile. The project will also develop targeted communication about the opportunities for local change, contribute to global leadership from Latin Americans and will ensure visibility and discussion of an agenda for action at the national, regional, and international level. It will therefore capitalize on the opportunities presented by the UN COP 26 and UN Food Systems Summit in 2021. The project will be led jointly by IDEC Brazil, CEDES Argentina and Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez, Chile.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

This short-term project is an outcome of the partnership between Wellcome and IDRC to consolidate evidences and develop an agenda for action promoting sustainable and healthy food systems in Latin America. It is based upon previous years of IDRC programming on healthy food systems in Latin America and the mutual interest of Wellcome and IDRC to expand the debate and strengthen pathways toward food systems change with both public health and environmental co-benefits. The one year project supported a collaborative agenda led by three national multidisciplinary research teams from Argentina, Brazil and Chile, in partnership with multiple actors and organizations linking the fields of public health nutrition, climate change and sustainable development. Relevant outcomes were achieved:

1. In the three countries, multidisciplinary teams achieved a solid understanding of how the political-institutional determinants affect food systems. Based upon common methodological guidelines and periodic exchanges, the three research teams consolidated evidence from the literature and policy reviews, and developed national stakeholder analysis as key inputs for the establishment of critical networking and the discussion of emerging agendas for action. A better understanding was achieved of governance challenges as well as of knowledge and policy gaps.

In the three countries, an important body of literature and constituencies address the public health dimensions of food systems and the field of sustainable agriculture production. However, there is not yet a body of literature devoted to the interface between healthy, environmental and climate friendly food systems. Similarly, with a few exceptions in Brazil, weak and focalized links were found between stakeholder groups active in the field of sustainable agriculture and the public health dimensions of the food system. While a critical mass of players have advanced the agenda of healthy food consumption in the three countries, the field of sustainable and climate friendly food consumption is only emerging.

2. The three country teams, in consultation with a varied set of key constituencies, developed the basis for an action research agenda promoting the transition to healthy, sustainable, climate friendly food systems. Given the relevance of agriculture and livestock as a source of greenhouse gas emissions in countries as Argentina and Brazil, and the increasing patterns of unhealthy food consumption in the LAC region, the proposed agenda for action made emphasis on building bridges across multiple sectors and disciplines.

In Brazil, based on the findings of the study "The five dimensions of the Food System" (see the outputs section below), an Agenda for Action was shared and launched with the involvement of multiple actors to support key actions to transition to a health-promoting, climate and environment friendly food system. The agenda for action in Brazil is based on the global syndemic framework that links malnutrition, climate change and food systems. It includes an understanding of the governance challenges of political and economic dependencies on the current agriculture paradigm. A strong network of multisectoral players constitute an opportunity to support a new field of research and action bridging healthy, climate friendly and sustainable food systems.

In Argentina, the agenda proposed a set of actions to increase fruits and vegetables consumption, reduce meat and ultra-processed food consumption, and limit the negative environmental impacts of agriculture, with emphasis on livestock, the major source of greenhouse gas agriculture emissions. It also highlighted the need to consider the deep cultural roots of animal-based food, and the low perception of the climate and health implications of meat and ultra-processed food consumption. Regulatory policies should anticipate and act upon conflicts of interest, and develop new initiatives to increase consumers awareness, such as including estimates of climate and environmental impacts in the National Dietary Guidelines.

In Chile, the project supported a series of working tables at the National Senate involving different actors and with the engagement of several senators. Relevant recommendations emerged as the need to strengthen institutions to advance a sustainable food consumption and production agenda, strengthen regulations including increasing economic incentives to carbon sequestering in soil, increased funding for sustainable production initiatives, regulations leading to restricting access to unhealthy food, economic tools to decrease the consumption of unhealthy food, and funding to R&amp;D projects on healthy and climate friendly food systems.

3. The three project teams reached key constituencies and set the basis for multistakeholder coalitions in support of healthy affordable diets while keeping greenhouse gas emissions within sustainable limits. They were capable of building bridges between different constituencies as a key input for building a new field of healthy and sustainable food systems. The project leaders were well connected with research networks but also reached strategic stakeholders as in Chile, where the project was capable of putting the topic in the agenda of the Senate Committee for the Challenges of the Future, Science, Technology and Innovation. Four Working Tables were organized by the Senate Committee to address issues of a) sustainable food production, b) food distribution and commercialization, c) healthy food environments, and d) healthy diets.

IDEC, the recipient institution in Brazil, achieved a leadership role at the national linking climate and public health constituencies and also at the international level, by engaging with regional and global networks. Multiple joint actions with national and international partners were developed with relevant actors as the People's Counter Mobilization to Transform Corporate Food System (Global and LAC Food Systems Summit), contribution to WHO COP26 Special Report on CC and Health, Brazilian Climate Observatory, FIAN Colombia and FIAN International, the COLANSA network, the Health and Climate International Network, Civil Society and Indigenous People's Mechanism for Relations with the UN Committee on World Food Security, and others that allowed IDEC Brazil to position itself as an active actor within the international civil society constituency in favor of healthy and climate friendly food systems.

4. The three country organizations emerged stronger after the project, with a better understanding of the challenges, their respective strengths and weaknesses, with stronger links and better recognized as active actors in the food systems agenda. Capacities were developed in terms of the analysis of the political economy and governance of food systems and the analytical strengths

to link food systems health, environment and climate dimensions. The network of involved institutions have the capacity to play a leading role in the region and globally. In particular, the LAC Community of Practice on Food Systems (COLANSA), a network that emerged in the region in the past years with support from IDRC and led by IDEC Brazil, strengthened its approach on the role of food systems in the sustainability agenda, and is very well placed to strengthen its leadership role.

5. The overall communications strategy, led by IDEC, developed multiple dissemination actions and successfully positioned the proposed Agenda for Action at the national and regional level. The communications plan embraced a novel Feeding Policies web platform, a very active social media strategy, position papers to support the advocacy strategy, 10 media outlets published in the Feeding Policies website, 24 media pieces published in 14 Brazilian news vehicles with a total of 67 media outlets and journalists contacted, and the participation in multiple national and international events.

Regarding the international positioning, the project was important and timely in supporting cross-sectoral engagement and dialogues that were called-for during the UN Food Systems Summit, a year of heightened profile and activity related to the needs of food systems change globally. However, Latin American governments' engagement in the UN Food Systems Summit processes in 2021 was limited and arguably less than countries from other regions. The Summit process was met with some skepticism and criticism from civil society organisations in Latin America. Despite this, the activities of the project were conducted independently of the Summit and provided for genuine agenda-building with relevant stakeholders across government and civil society.

In Argentina, an active communication strategy was developed during the project and included the participation in a total of 34 events at the national, regional and international level. Two national dialogues involved researchers, advocacy players and decision makers to discuss the results of the project. In Chile, as an outcome of the multi-actor Working Tables organized at the Senate Committee, four policy briefs and brochures were developed on each of the four topics of the Working Tables.

# PROJECT OUTCOMES

## 4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

The project made a significant contribution to build the field of healthy and sustainable food systems in the LAC Region. Former IDRC supported projects in LAC had a focus on regulatory policies for healthy food systems. This project made a significant progress in expanding the field of research and action to consider environment and climate friendly food systems. The project also enabled to strengthen inter-country team links and broader the networking scope to different type of actors and reach a broader constituency.

## 5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

The project was capable to achieve very good results despite the short duration of the project (12 months) and the challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The advanced state of networking and collaboration across institutions of Latin America remain excellent opportunities to support their further development of leadership and influence in food systems at local and global levels.

## 6. How did this project contribute one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the Strategic Plan. Provide specific numbers where possible.

- Invest in knowledge and innovation for large-scale positive change
- Build the leaders for today and tomorrow
- Be the partner of choice for greater impact

The project contributed to Climate Resilient Food Systems and the overall Strategy 2030 given its focus on linking healthy and climate friendly outcomes of the food system in LAC.

It made a significant contribution to IDRC's strategic objective on knowledge for large-scale positive change by enabling a stronger understanding of the governance challenges, knowledge and policy gaps of food systems and convening key constituencies in the region to discuss the Agenda for Action.

The project contributed to consolidate the leadership of IDRC supported organizations, such as IDEC Brazil that developed novel working collaborations. IDEC also contributed to the strengthening of the COLANSA regional network, currently supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies.

As part of an IDRC partnership with Wellcome in the field of food systems, the project facilitated multiple novel interactions and partnerships at the national and regional levels and achieved to make a meaningful contribution to the field of healthy and sustainable food systems.

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

Wellcome's senior officer in charge of the project was involved in several meetings with the three research teams before and during the project implementation.

The mitigation strategies were useful to support the project by developing a sound analysis of the political economy and stakeholder analysis in countries as Brazil and Argentina where the importance the agriculture sector and more specifically meat production have a strong economic importance.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

The three teams were very well equipped to address ethical issues, mostly related to interviews with stakeholders, managing the consultation process and discussion of the agenda for action. Literature and policy reviews were limited to secondary data.

Program Leader / Manager comments

Program Leaders/Managers should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

Note, on background: This initiative of the two funding partners, Wellcome and IDRC, and Latin American organizations followed several years of discussions about cooperation between Global Health programs of IDRC and the Our Plant Our Health program of Wellcome which was at one point leading to a co-investment in the CCHeFS initiative which was stalled due to a strategic review at Wellcome. The Wellcome contribution to the project was initially envisaged as a potential bridge to future partnership opportunities when Wellcome's corporate strategy was to be finalised. Formal co-funding partnership with Wellcome has not eventuated, however this project continues to serve as a modest indicator or what could be done together to build the field of cross-disciplinary work in food systems in LAC.

The project partners in Chile, Brazil and Argentina continue to lead and collaborate with other organizations across Latin America (particularly through the COLANSA network referred to above) with influential research and advocacy, particularly focussed on public health outcomes. They have yet to secure funding to advance the more environment/climate-focused goals of this project. The lack of continuity of support has been a disappointment, but the knowledge and relationships established through this project remains an opportunity.

integrated evidence-based agenda for action that prioritizes healthy, affordable diets while keeping greenhouse gas emissions within sustainable limits.

I want to highlight how the project made a significant contribution to building the field of healthy and sustainable food systems in the Latin America and Caribbean region. The project expanded the field of research and action to consider environment and climate-friendly food systems. It also enabled the strengthening of inter-country team links and broader networking scope to different types of actors. Additionally, the project contributed to the development of policy briefs, brochures, and national dialogues that supported genuine agenda-building with relevant stakeholders across government and civil society.

Even though we couldn't continue with the partners in a second phase, the project had a positive impact on promoting healthy and sustainable food systems in the LAC region. It has also informed the CRFS vision on this area. This PCR is a good starting point for the design of a new portfolio on this pillar of the CRFS PIP.

I approve this PCR
