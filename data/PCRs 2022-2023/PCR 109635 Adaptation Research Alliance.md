## Program Leader comments

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

In a very concise and strategic PCR the Program leader responsible of ARA summarizes the beginning of a key alliance for IDRC's vision on Adaptation and Resilience. As presented by Bruce, by leading on IDRC-led consultations to identify research needs and opportunities related to food systems and to gender, equality and inclusion the center has both demonstrated thought leadership and alignment with CRFS PIP.

The synergies of ARA with CLARE and IDRC's partnership with FCDO are well established and it is important to continuing the engagement and participation with the Alliance. The risks identified on tis PCR provide the clear guidelines on how to continue our engagement, contributions, and the new opportunities with ARA.

I approve this PCR

Santiago Alba-Corral

Director CRFS.
