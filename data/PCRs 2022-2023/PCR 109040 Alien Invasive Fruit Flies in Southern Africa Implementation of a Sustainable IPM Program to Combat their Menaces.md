# Project Abstract

Mangoes are an important fruit crop in sub-Saharan Africa, as a source of nutritious food, employment, and opportunities for livelihood improvement. However, high infestation of insect pests, especially fruit flies (native and invasive), hamper mango productivity in the region. Fruit fly infestations reduce the quality and quantity of fruits produced for both local and foreign markets. Conventional use of synthetic insecticides for management of these pests is unsustainable (for their price and risks to humans and the environment) and subject to increasing resistance. To address these challenges, the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE) and partners have developed and validated a fruit fly Integrated Pest Management (IPM) package that have been tested in several locations in East and West Africa.

This project adapted and promoted the wide-scale adoption of these IPM interventions (i.e., mass trapping using lures, use of protein baits, sanitation, and use of biological pesticides) in four Southern African countries, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. A series of these interventions were tested to increase their fit to specific locations. In particular, the use of parasitoids was refined through field releases, post-release evaluation and assessment of the impact of their release in the field for the suppression of invasive fruit flies.

With a specific focus on women and youth, the project also assessed the socioeconomic impacts of IPM option and enhanced human and institutional capacity of partners to use the technologies. Reaching up to 4,000 mango growers, including resource-poor men and women farmers, the project improved food and nutrition security, provided income generation opportunities and reduced poverty.

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

1. The capacity building and outreach achieved in this project were a highlight. A total of 4,075 mango farmers, out of which 62% were women, were trained to become trainers on Integrated Pest Management (IPM) technique against the fruit fly. A further 11,131, out of which 47% were women, were directly reached using the farmer field day approach hosted by trained farmers and agricultural extension officers to demonstrate and discuss the technologies in the field. All of them were provided with IPM starter packs (including traps, lures, attractants, food baits, etc.). And they all used IPM technologies throughout the project implementation cycle. In addition, through the project a total of 10,369 secondary school students, out of which 49% were girls, were trained on various aspects of fruit fly IPM, and a total of 6 postgraduate students (66% female) pursuing PhDs and MScs took part in the project and received training in various aspects of the project.

2. Reduction of post-harvest loss: Even though the COVID-19 has been a largely impeding factor to the research project, it nonetheless was a pretext for the team to think outside the box and innovate with other ways for farmers, and in particular women farmers, to continue earning a living and bring food to their family table. They managed to turn around quickly and innovate with the development of a micro project using simple basket dryers made of polyethylene nets. Women could dry their mangoes and obtain higher prices when selling them. In Zambia and Zimbabwe for example, dried mango can be sold 8 times more than fresh fruit. Mainly applied to excess mangoes not consumed locally, this simple technique is a strong contribution to reducing postharvest losses and to increase family income while providing a source of nutritious food during the down season.

3. Gender highlight, Women empowerment: The project explored the use of the survey-based index called Project-Level Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (pro-WEAI) to understand the drivers of women empowerment and disempowerment, both internal and external and how this is linked to their willingness to consider paying for the fruit fly protection package based on IPM techniques. The analysis revealed that willingness to pay was positively linked to access to extension services and levels of education and income, among other factors, while the distance to the market, and losses attributed to fruit flies were on the contrary refraining them. It therefore appears from the results that uptake and adoption of agricultural innovations is only possible if articulated with women's access to agricultural extension services, technologies that lower their workload while at the same time improving incomes. The project also showed that efforts to promote access and reduce workload such as those deployed in this project have the potential to contribute to narrowing the gender gap and increase empowerment, with for example an augmentation of 6% in Zambia. The solar dryers also proved to be a source of economic revenue for women and an addition to the food source for their households. Additionally, the farmers' groups initiated by the project started revolving savings and credit stokvels where members regularly saved the income that accrued from their produce, loaned it out to themselves and other community members and periodically shared profits. From the stokvel proceeds, women purchased food in bulk and shared, and some acquired livestock.

4. The project succeeded in showing the usefulness of IPM techniques and their positive impact on production, with seven out of ten mangoes saved from fruit fly infestation. In addition, household annual income generated from mango crop in Zambia increasing from 7 to 18%. Farmers testified that the IPM techniques also

3. If appropriate, explain why outputs were not completed or were of poor quality.
Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

A working paper on the cost-benefit analysis of IPM technologies and practices compared to other methods was supposed to be produced but this became unnecessary since the baseline survey showed that most farmers were not using chemical pesticides or other methods to control invasive fruit flies to which compare the IPM approach.

Another report was not completed on parasitoids establishment, dispersal, and effectiveness in suppression of fruit flies since the MSc. student who was supposed to conduct this work abandoned. Field observation from the team showed that the parasitoids established in mango farms, however, it's a missed opportunity to not have collected data on this. More so given it was one of the objectives of the project.

Another important output was to build capacity and upgrading national laboratories in parasitoid rearing as a means of sustainability beyond project implementation. This could not be achieved fully in Zambia and Malawi. Malawi could not start rearing parasitoids due to strict regulations from their National Agricultural Technology Clearing Committee which requires comprehensive testing of technologies before they are adopted. As for Zambia, there was no technician dedicated to this, while parasitoid rearing requires specialized conditions involving light, aeration, temperature and humidity regulation, and rearing cages, it needs constant attention.

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?
Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

The main contribution of the project was in terms on scientific findings, which resulted in several peer reviewed publications that contributed to fill knowledge gaps on IPM strategy against fruit flies. Among others, papers produced:

- Explored the use of semiochemicals for suppression of fruit flies: Fruit flies produce chemical substances to mark their host when laying eggs to deter other fruit flies of the same species from placing their eggs on the same mango. The project tested products (glutathione and glutamic acid) as host marking pheromones. The results showed effectiveness against the native fruit fly but not the alien one. Therefore, further developed and commercialised, this product could contribute to the IPM package against fruit flies. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/ps.7331.
- Studied interaction between the host plant, the parasitoid as control agent and some bacteria in the gut of the fruit flies. The study showed that some bacteria are beneficial to parasitoids by increasing the chances of their emergence from fruit

flies and by increasing their size at emergence. This result can be used in mass-rearing wasps for release in mango orchards. https://www.mdpi.com/2079-7737/12/2/274.

- Characterized the land, land use and land cover at a landscape level: data collected in project sites together with satellite data were analyzed and mango orchards were shown to occupy 18% of the studied districts https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/10/5741. The results triggered massive awareness and increased farmers' desire to increase mango tree stands and to receive training in tree grafting, which was provided by the project. Farmers are currently grafting improved mango varieties using indigenous drought-resistant trees as rootstock.
- Conducted modeling of areas suitable for parasitoids establishment, determined the temperature thresholds for the parasitoid using life cycle simulation modeling and analysed implications for effective field releases in classical biological control of fruit flies https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0255582

# 5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

The project overachieved in many senses, with more farmers sensitised and trained than planned, more open access peer reviewed papers produced, more training material, etc. On the other hand, a few important results were not achieved. One is the link with the private sector, an important element of a scaling up strategy. The project intended to create links with private mango processing and packaging companies and other mango aggregators. However, the projects only reached to influence the production for household consumption and sale of surplus to the local markets. Intents have been made regarding the use of dryers, but the production of dry fruit is too dependent on the temperature, and the alternative, large capacity greenhouse driers, was explored, but not implemented. This would have required a strategy from the start with commitment from the private partner (rather than at the end). It may be possible that the researchers did not have the necessary skills to facilitate private sector linkages. The same for the IPM package, the final report itself mentions that interested farmers can't currently buy the materials because it's not available or it's too expensive. Even though materials were available in South Africa, the suppliers lacked sufficient demand to purchase and deliver in bulk at affordable prices.

This aspect of the project was not sufficiently thought through in advance, the project remained in the early days of proving and finetuning the use the IPM technology. Probably the delays occasioned by COVID-19 didn't help the team to integrate quickly this aspect. This is, in my view, a missed opportunity since we already know it's useful and working, the time has come for real-life experiments with the whole value chain involved and committed. Their recommendation is an area-wide control of fruit flies approach to sustain the demand for inputs, thus creating a business opportunity for the private sector to position themselves and exploit the market gap. I'm not convinced this is the best approach, as this way the proof remains always in the hand of the researchers, instead of involving the interested private sector from the start so they participate in the conception of these very tools and share the risk related to its development. The advice from an economist could be helpful here.

A significant part of the project energy and resources was dedicated to finetuning and filling gaps in knowledge regarding the IPM technologies. In another such project, I would strongly suggest reducing this part and allocate a higher proportion of the resource to build the relation with the private sector (who would have to be on board from the project development stage).

In addition, as mentioned earlier, one of these tests of the efficiency of the technique (post release evaluation of the establishment of the parasitoid) was not done as the student abandoned. If really proof is still needed, this should have been prioritised and not left unattended.

Gender marker: based on the proposal and discussion with the team, the PO assessed the project as "Gender responsive" in the PAD and indicated that it had "Intention for women's empowerment". Now that the project has ended, it seems that this assessment was correct. The project used pro-WEAI that provided new insights on women's empowerment, and what affected their willingness to pay for IPM package. The project showed that the use of the IPM package reduce women drudgery, as it doesn't involve carrying sprayers of chemical insecticides: Once traps with lures are hung on the tree they continue being effective for 4 to 6 weeks without requiring attention from the farmer. The mango drying activity is also not heavy in workload since the dryers are easy-to-make, and the slicing of the mangoes can be done by the whole family, including the man of the family. And it helped women to provide nutritious food to the school going children during the season of food scarcity.

The very project activities were designed in a way to increase women's access to agricultural extension information (with activities conducted at a time when both men and women are free and flexibility regarding breastfeeding mothers). Saving groups were constituted, and savings were used to lend money to fellow farmers in the community at a small interest rate, to pay school fees for their children, to buy cows, goats, and pigs or to open a bank account for the women, to have more control over their finances.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?
Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.
Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

The project contributed to large scale positive impacts, with more than 11 thousand farmers (of which 47% are women) trained to use IPM technologies, which allow them to reduce their losses due to insect pests from 80% to 30%. It also contributed to build the leaders for today and tomorrow with some 10,369 secondary school students, out of which 49% were females, trained on various aspects of fruit fly IPM and a total of 6 postgraduate students (4 female and 2 male) who received training in various aspects of the project.

It also greatly contributed to a transversal objective on gender. The project enhanced women's access to agricultural extension information through activities tailored towards inclusivity, and they had major role in decision-making in participatory and monitoring groups. Armed with this knowledge, women have constituted groups that pool resources together to conduct activities of their choice.

The project struggled with the continued depreciation of the Zambian Kwacha. Most required items for the research (for example traps and lures) more than doubled during the life of the project, which posed serious constraints to the implementation of activities in Zambia. Are there examples or precedent where we can better support our grantees on this? Are we allowed to suggest them to create an account in a more stable currency for example?

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

The COVID-19 pandemic was not anticipated, and it caused delays in training and awareness activities. The project team was quick to react and introduced a small study on the potential to use locally available mango drying as a way of preserving and adding value to the fruits which could not be taken to the markets. Very well received by the farmers, this addition also contributed to lessons the Center could extract from the whole pandemic experience, it's effect on field research and possible solutions.

The PAD identified the high technical nature of IPM technologies that was to be mitigated through a strong focus on capacity building. It didn't anticipate that in one country, IPM technologies would be hard to upscale due to a requirement by the National Agricultural Technology Clearing Committee that all technologies be tested first before upscaling no matter how simple or vital they are, including for traditional method such as solar drying. This was the case in Malawi and the national team should have warned the bigger team of this issue so that it would have been taken into account.

There was a risk that the research team would not properly integrate gender and social dimensions of IPM implementation in the four countries and therefore not being able to achieve the objective of the project to assess the socioeconomic and gender impacts of the IPM interventions in the mango production and value chain. This risk was addressed by the inclusion of a gender expert in the project, and the addition of a supporting team that would help teams to conduct ProWEAI. This proved quite satisfactory, as the team, mainly composed of technical scientists at first managed to integrate and address gender questions in a significant way. However, given the late introduction of the ProWEAI approach (at project inception workshop), it was difficult for the team to add this in their budget and activities, and it was only done in one country.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

## Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

A very thorough PCR, sharing the lessons from this project, the many positive outcomes, outputs and weaknesses. As noted, it would be desirable to follow-up to verify the extent that the short-term outcomes will be sustained in years/seasons to come.

As CRFS moves into the future, after initiatives like CultiAF, with less emphasis on individual crops and value chains, projects like this provide for important lessons on community engagement, gender integration, and opportunities to better incentivise and engage businesses that can make healthy, regenerative produce more reliable and affordable for local consumers.

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

This PCR emphasizes the crucial need to develop sustainable Integrated Pest Management (IPM) packages that are effective against specific pests and tailored to local conditions for improving food security and reducing post-harvest loss in other regions. The project also highlights the importance of capacity building and farmer outreach, especially women and youth, to promote the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices.

The results presented by the PO and the TL demonstrate the significance of assessing the socioeconomic impacts of IPM options and enhancing human and institutional capacity to use the technologies with a gender equality approach. It is important to highlight the potential of using simple innovative solutions, such as basket dryers made of polyethylene nets, to reduce post-harvest loss and increase family income.

In summary, this project serves as an exemplary model that balances technological solutions with integrated social and economic aspects, which can address inequalities and promote more sustainable food systems by reducing food waste and losses.
