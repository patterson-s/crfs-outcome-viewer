# Faits saillants du projet

Quels sont les cinq plus importants résultats (extrants ou incidences) de ce projet et en quoi se sont-ils avérés utiles ou novateurs?

New knowledge generated and documented from a highly fragile region in three provinces northeast of Democratic Republic Congo (DRC) (Bas-Uélé, Haut-Uélé, and Ituri) on:

- the pattern of change of several hydro-climatic indices (including extreme ones) as drivers of conflicts and migration in the actual past (1960–2018) and anticipated future (until 2100) in three Congo River Bassin (CRB) sub-basins (Uele, Aruwimi, and Itimbiri) and over the entire CRB;
- a gender analysis of the climate-water-migration-conflict interactions across 13 areas (such as access to safe drinking water, preservation and sharing of the use of water resources for agriculture and livestock, income generation, food security and livelihoods);
- the mixed effects of conflict and migration in the sociocultural context of the CRB, where state and customary water sharing rules apply in tandem with intense climatic variability.

Information came from on-the-ground meteorological stations, geospatial data, space observations, and field gender-desegraded data that were collated by mixed methods using household enumeration forms, survey questionnaires, focus group, semi-structured interviews (with key informants and focus groups), and surveys on migrants' itineraries from the Mbororo pastoralists. One hundred and fifty households in each province by cluster were surveyed and 1008 individuals were surveyed in the field using household enumeration forms and survey questionnaires, focus groups and semi-structured interviews. Five sociolinguistic groups (Fulani or Mbororo [transhumant], indigenous Pygmy peoples, Bantu, Sudanese, and Nilotic peoples of various origins) were surveyed. Results were published in a book, one scientific report on gender analysis, six peer-reviewed articles, five master's theses, and eight policy briefs. This is innovative and useful because the study portrays a basin that will undergo an intensification in drought and flood frequency in the future. It can also be used to guide the development of gender-sensitive adaptation approaches towards enhancing flood and disaster management, vulnerability mapping, flood monitoring systems, early warning systems, development of infrastructure, and other socioeconomical aspects. Finally, this region is understudied, hard to access and investigate, and prone to security risks, the infrastructure is weak or non-existent, and existing research, particularly gender related research, lacks adequate data.

The creation of an integrated information system (open access database) to address the climate-water-migration-conflict nexus in the Congo Basin based on a multidisciplinary methodological approach to designing appropriate tools for field surveys and data collection campaigns, data analysis, and creating a statistical database and a web interface with the aim to make this information system publicly available for users and stakeholders. This information system is a structured and organized set of quantitative and qualitative data on the climate-water-migration-conflict nexus and gender, consisting of primary data collected during field surveys across three provinces (Bas-Uélé, Haut-Uélé, and l'Ituri). It contains 250 aggregated variables or 575 disaggregated variables, all grouped into 15 thematic areas, including: identification; socio-demographic characteristics; access to resources; perception of climate change; perception of migration; financial inclusion (savings, access to credit and circulation of money); domination and control of water resources, land ownership, and property rights, conflict resolution and community resilience; water uses; vulnerability to climate change; housing, household

--- Page 1 ---

assets, and household expenditure; food security; health, hygiene, and sanitation; environmental risk management; women's economic autonomy; and water transfer from the Congo Basin to Lake Chad. The information system is innovative and useful because it can model the interface of human-environment interactions and develop scenarios to address the challenges of climate change and resilient development in understudied provinces while supporting key policy areas and strategies to foster effective stakeholder participation to ensure management and governance of climate and natural resources.

The photo story album was particularly useful for monitoring from a distance the activities of the project in the three northern provinces: Ituri, Bas-Uélé and Haut-Uélé. Throughout the implementation of the research project, the team captured veridic photos reflecting the reality in these unknown areas, allowing them to tell a story primarily through images. Each individual image also has a caption that provides in-depth information or context for that photo, helping to narrate the story. In the opinion of the responsible PO, the photo story method is a legitimate research tool for monitoring, particularly in the pandemic context and/or in high-risk areas. It was an effective and powerful research tool providing unique, rich, and informative qualitative data.

The Gender at Work support (RSP 108989) aimed to create a space for learning on gender and social inclusion with the project team through mentoring, coaching, technical support, online discussions, and annual peer learning meetings. The approaches used included learning-by-doing, by focusing on the research products the team had to deliver, and engaging the team in collaborative approaches, with an openness to questioning and discussion to build gender capacity. In close collaboration with Sylvie Desautels and the responsible officer, a dozen junior members of the research team (except the PI):

- increased their willingness to learn, awareness, attitudes, basic knowledge, and confidence to engage on gender;
- developed an understanding that gender can be studied and integrated into research projects in a "scientific way";
- improved their attitude towards integrating gender in a cross-cutting way—despite creating a separate report;
- deepened their knowledge and understanding of gender analysis and tools, gender-differentiated impacts of climate change, and links between gender-based inequalities and climate change adaptation strategies;
- acquired a common language and keys for analysis, which allowed the researchers to consider and deepen these reflections in the data analysis work;
- improved methods, including a strong gender perspective.

All these improvements are visible in the latest version of the gender analysis report: Analyse Genre sur le nexus Climat-Eau-Migrations-Conflits dans la partie Nord-Est de la République Démocratique du Congo, which shows that participants have a good understanding of how inequalities, including informal sociocultural norms and practices that perpetuate discrimination, influence vulnerabilities to climate change and therefore must be acknowledged and transformed in adaptation strategies. The team members were able to use the Gender at Work analytical framework appropriately and analyze how adaptation opportunities meet the specific and strategic needs of women.

Five students graduated. The project provided funds to train five junior master's students from University of Kinshasa who have all now graduated. All the students were extremely driven and were involved in the gender mini-team and in the writing of the co-authored scientific articles. All the students are now occupying positions as research assistants and/or have started a PhD with subsequent scholarships. Providing scholarships and facilitating resource access (such as access to databases, software, and computers) for students was an essential component of this project in the DRC, where access to resources is extremely limited. In the opinion of the PO, supporting young researchers is a key goal in a region of the world where the average income is less than $1.90 a day, making it difficult for many students to afford further education.

assessment and response to water-related migration.

S'il y a lieu, donner les raisons pour lesquelles les extrants n'ont pas vu le jour ou étaient de piètre qualité.

Overall, the outputs are good quality, but the project produced results across three areas or components (hydro-climatic, gender, and migration/conflicts) led by three different sub-groups, and their lack of collaboration and integration is reflected in the outputs generated. The PI's role in coordinating and integrating the different components was unsuccessful.

For instance, the gender aspects were treated and reported separately. Even after an extensive discussion of the advantages, disadvantages, and challenges of a cross-sectional gender analysis integrated into the main research report versus a separate gender analysis report, the CRREBaC chose the latter option. The PO and Sylvie Desautels from Gender at Work worked collaboratively to find an adaptive strategy. In close consultation with Sylvie, the PO finally agreed to move forward with a separate gender analysis report so the momentum of the work already achieved by Sylvie would not be disrupted and the young researchers already involved in the gender work would not be penalized.

Another example is the regional articles, which used secondary online data and were reported as outputs by UNU-INWEH but did not involve the team in Kinshasa.

## Résultats du projet

4. Comment le projet a-t-il contribué au champ d'étude ou de recherche?

The project is innovative because it conducted empirical investigations to find up-to-date hydro-climatic and socioeconomic information in a data-scarce area. The Congo River Basin is the second-largest river basin in the world, after the Amazon, and it has a drainage area of approximately $3.7\mathrm{Mkm}^2$ and is home to 75 million people. The project was important to fund because a significant portion of the population is exposed to recurrent floods and droughts, and climate change is likely to worsen these events. Climate change studies of the Congo River basin have so far focused on annual and seasonal precipitation, with little attention paid to extreme climatic events and even less attention to gender-sensitive adaptation strategies.

The key scientific findings and their implications can be divided into three major areas and have been well summarized in the three following policy briefs:

--- Page 5 ---

Knowledge generated of hydro-climatic factors and changes in land/water cover that influence spatial and temporal patterns of climate and water-driven migration and conflicts in the Congo Basin

See key findings here: Climate and water variabilities as drivers of conflicts and migration in the Congo River basin

Overall, the potential risk of the observed water variabilities with anticipated CC influences in the CRB is very high. The results suggest that in all periods and scenarios, the rise in evapotranspiration due to higher temperatures will offset annual precipitation increases in the northern, eastern, and western extremities of the basin. Increased evaporation will exacerbate the decrease in annual precipitation in the centre, leading to increased drought frequency in the entire basin. Specific recommendations include:

Significant improvement of climate and water monitoring throughout the basin, including installing ground meteorological stations at identified hotspots, utilizing remote sensing data, and developing relevant capacity for flood, drought, and famine early warning systems.

Resolving the issue of basic human needs throughout the CRB, including access to domestic water supply and sanitation, healthcare facilities, and food banks. This should help alleviate the need to migrate, even if partially.

Developing water storage infrastructure in the hotspots of projected water and climate variability increases and/or implementing nature-based solutions where appropriate.

Adopting inclusive regional hydro-diplomacy within an all-actors framework of actions to ensure participation of all relevant stakeholders in decision-making across the central African region.

New knowledge on gender-differentiated impacts of climate change and links between gender-based inequalities and climate change adaptation strategies

See key findings here: Gender Analysis of the Climate-Water-Migration-Conflict Interactions in the Democratic Republic of Congo

Overall, the current socioeconomic-political-cultural practices in parts of the DRC are gender discriminatory and widen differential vulnerabilities, particularly for women. Specific recommendations to reduce gender inequalities, abate the need to migrate, and strengthen the resilience of vulnerable communities may include:

Facilitating inclusive land tenure security and access to economic resources like credits and other agricultural inputs (e.g., labour-enhancing tools/facilities) to improve women's contribution to agro-production, food security, and economic development.

Integrating both genders in decision-making platforms as it relates to resource management of water (water management committees), education, and communal and political administration. This should inform and consolidate dialogues with stakeholders, create gender-sensitive communication tools, and establish structures for mediation and conflict resolution with the aim of promoting gender equality.

Sustainable improvement of climate and water monitoring for development of, for example, famine early warning systems, particularly in the Uélé sub-basin (identified hotspot for drought) in Bas-Uélé province. Also, raising women's technical capacities in agro-production with the use of CC-resilient seeds and crops, conservation practices, and preservation techniques for resilient adaptation to CC.

--- Page 6 ---

New knowledge of Indigenous and local knowledge and socioeconomic, cultural, and political drivers that influence spatial and temporal patterns of climate- and water-driven migration and conflicts in the Congo Basin

See key findings here: Transhumance Pastoralism and Mbororo Pastoralists in climate-Water-Migration-Conflict Context of the Congo River Basin

In all, transhumance pastoralism and current practices of Mbororo pastoralists in climate-water conflict-migration nexus are climate-sensitive. Going forward, recommendations to be implemented to address the impacts of conflicts from climate-induced, pastoralist-related, and associated challenges of the receiving communities in the CRB may include:

Facilitating transhumant-farmer relations through clarification of transhumant pastoralists' legal status, public sensitization to transhumance and its economic importance, engagement of extension workers, and building relevant capacity for resource management, human relations, security, and health.

Sustainable investment in basic human services (e.g., large water storage infrastructure and healthcare facilities) and climate/water monitoring systems throughout the CRB—to address the effects of CC on pastoralists and the receiving communities, strengthen resilience, and alleviate migration, albeit in part.

Reformulating and adopting inclusive regulations for land rights, natural resource management, and water allocation—to promote peaceful coexistence.

Promotion of justice and prevention of human rights abuses through the establishment of conflict resolution committee at all (local, national, and regional) levels and implementation of inclusive conflict prevention measures.

En quoi les résultats atteints se distinguent-ils des résultats escomptés ? Pour quels motifs les choses se sont-elles passées ainsi? Y a-t-il eu des résultats inattendus découlant du projet? Le projet a-t-il évolué différemment de ce qui était indiqué dans le document d'approbation de projet? Pourquoi les résultats inattendus se sont-ils produits? Quelles ont été les répercussions ?

This project was submitted in response to the open call for proposals "Accelerating Climate Action: Social Equity and Empowerment of Women and Girls" (108870), launched March 8, 2018. The proposal was submitted conjointly by University of Kinshasa and UNU-INWEH (as co-proponent) and selected by an internal and external committee composed of Kallur Murali Subrammanyam, Deborah Rubin, Edith Ofwona, Charlotte MacAlister. The project was transferred to Melanie Robertson after the departure of Charlotte MacAlister and the approval process went smoothly.

## Context analysis

The PO realized after a few months that the main author of the proposal originally submitted to IDRC was a researcher based in UNU-INWEH and the key gender experts were all based at UNU as well. Consequently, the assigned responsible PO quickly realized that urgent capacity building was needed for the core team in CRREBaC, University of Kinshasa. CRREBaC had no experience integrating gender issues into a research project and the PI was defensive, not willing to open a discussion channel with Gender at Work.

Among IDRC's project portfolio, the DRC gender and CC research seemed to have the most challenges and constraints: since the first face-to-face meeting with the PO, the Principal Investigator

--- Page 7 ---

(PI) from Kinshasa was resistant to including gender, even though the call for proposals and the signed contract were clear. IDRC explained that this was not negotiable, highlighted the objectives from their GA, and gave CRREBaC the opportunity to take some steps towards learning, even if minimal and without the PI, on gender approaches and issues.

What was hindering the change?

The research team leadership was male-dominated, and the women invisible, and the PI's style of management centralized control of information and decision-making, with other team members waiting for his instructions and not interacting with IDRC and Gender at work directly for at least six months.

Leadership was extremely defensive about control of and access to the research data and analysis and critical of western researchers' attitude that instrumentalizes southern researchers and institutions.

The impossibility of face-to-face workshops due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The research team's hierarchical power dynamics were not favourable to questioning and change.

Poor internet connectivity does not allow webinars with camera, which limits the quality of the interactions.

What was helping change?

The PO and Gender at Work worked collaboratively to find an adaptive strategy to increase trust, improve relationships, and create a learning space while respecting the hierarchy. Strategically, the PO and Sylvie from Gender at Work tried to get a sense of how the research team was operating and what they were doing around gender. We noticed that gender analysis capacity was very low, but also saw an openness and an interest from junior researchers to know more about gender approaches and analysis. We agreed not to push too hard and tried to set-up a gender reflection about their research practice until now with a small group of key motivated people (without PI).

Created a small group of key team members (core team of 5–7 that includes women) to develop a dialogue and an agenda for deepening the gender approach and analysis of the research products, moving towards understanding the gender transformative approach. Twice a month, plan and undertake webinar discussions with this group.

Together with this core team (not including the PI), organize webinars for all team members (around 15), opening the reflection and sharing insights and learnings (once a month).

Provide technical assistance (TA) on specific issues and comment reports as agreed with the PO and research team, if connected with Gender at Work core mandate.

The first face-to-face meeting in Kenya in 2019 with the six projects from three continents accelerated change due to peer learning: The action learning methodology fostered a sense of solidarity and peer support with others facing similar struggles in their project. The team in DRC composed of three young researchers definitely had their "aha moment" and this was a real turning point.

The observed unexpected changes for gender equality

Between 2019 and 2022, the project in DRC made phenomenal progress, as demonstrated below. The research team demonstrated actions in favour of the integration of gender issues in their research beyond the IDRC project, within the research team, in their research approaches, the institution, and in

--- Page 8 ---

its external, scientific and community collaborations. For instance:

The research team in Kinsahsa (CRREBaC) was able to identify lessons from the project and intends to apply them in future research projects, including incorporating a systematic gender approach, from methodology, sampling, data collection, and analysis to dissemination of results and advocacy:

At the methodological level: sampling should be consolidated, taking into account the representativeness of men and women on the one hand, and migrants and non-migrants on the other hand, with a view to improving the analysis of social inequalities in the study area. For this purpose, quota sampling is recommended instead of random cluster sampling.

At the level of further studies that could have been done better: study gender-based violence and sexual violence against vulnerable migrant and non-migrant women and girls to assess the risks of violence and sexual harassment in the context of climate change and conflicts in the study area.

Identify the root and underlying causes of gender inequalities that are not directly related to climate change; carry out in-depth analyses of exclusions related to age, migration status, women's health status, and the categories of women most vulnerable to the risks of climate change.

CRREBaC developed its gender equality strategy, which includes the revision of its Ethics and Deontology Code for Research, to integrate a gender perspective into all research and concrete measures to increase women's participation in all activities of the institution.

CRREBaC confirmed that the institution had made efforts to recruit more women researchers and that indeed the number of women on the team had increased.

In November 2021, CRREBaC contributed as key speaker to the first ever African Summit of Heads of State and Government on Positive Masculinity to End Violence against Women and Girls, led and hosted by DRC's president, through the production and transmission of a Note to decision-makers on cross-cutting gender issues.

Two junior members of the CRREBaC research team participated in an online training program on "Gender and Environment" offered by UN Climate Change e-Learn and obtained their certificates. This decision to go for further training to build their gender capacity in the context of climate change is indicative of their continuing interest and the sustainability of the influence of the intervention.

At a workshop in Kinshasa, on July 26–29, 2021, CRREBaC built capacity and provided gender-specific tools to 48 DCR-based institutions (public administration, private sector, civil society, higher education and academic-research institutions, specialized state services) to strengthen their strategies and programs for natural resource management and the fight against gender-based discrimination. This is a significant unexpected change from where CRREBaC started at the beginning of the project. The responsible PO and Sylvie from Gender at Work have heard from the gender consultant, Maggie, that there was space at the workshop to discuss gender as a key issue in climate change, migration, and VAW in this zone, in livelihoods, displaced people and burden on women, etc. CRREBaC made a good case. It was their first experience of bringing gender to the wider community and stakeholders. This demonstrates that they are confident and have bought into gender.

CRREBaC organized a conference on the occasion of International Women's Day, March 8, 2022, entitled: "Gender and climate change: issues on the situation of women and girls in the Democratic Republic of Congo."

--- Page 9 ---

In March 2022, CRREBaC presented three communications based on the funded research results under the theme of "Improving the enjoyment of the human rights of women and girls, and strengthening their resilience in the context of climate change" during Women's Month. For International Women's Day (IWD 2022): "Gender equality today for a sustainable future," with the national theme of: "Promoting the empowerment of women and girls in climate change and disaster risk reduction contexts." CRREBaC had presented a communication based on CEMiC research results of 3 activities organized for Women's Month. The first two activities (March 17 and 24, 2022) were attended by DRC civil society organizations and Canadian partners. The latest one, on March 31, 2022, was organized by the Carter Center in Kinshasa through its "Women's Voice and Leadership" Program, an initiative funded by Canada's Global Affairs that supports women's organizations in DRC. Ms. Maguy Nzuzi (CRREBaC gender expert) also participated in the first two events.

These changes would have been impossible without the involvement of Gender at Work. The learning-by-doing approach, based on openness to questioning and discussion, succeeded in building gender capacity and, more importantly, generated interest that continued beyond the project. The creation of safe and horizontal spaces for exchange and dialogue allowed the learning to emerge. Mentoring and coaching, working directly with researchers on data sets and draft reports (focusing on the research products CRREBaC had to deliver), as well as the practical use of gender analysis tools, gives the research team the opportunity to further analyze the data they had collected and draw meaningful conclusions. Through practice, they learned to integrate learnings, progress in their capacities, and improve the quality of the research product.

Working directly with researchers on data sets and report drafts seemed to provide an opportunity for deeper analysis of the data among the research team. The extent to which Sylvie and the responsible PO were able to influence these changes also relate to the approach (participatory and inclusive rather than didactic), working with real research content rather than the abstract examples used in gender training, and building on the trust that had been established. This opportunity also builds the capacity of the PO in a "real" setting as well (with the support of a gender expert).

A few observations on gender related capacity building process:

CRREBaC is an organization in which numerous collaborators do not have a permanent presence or role in the institution; they are called upon to contribute to certain projects and specific mandates. This organizational configuration means that the sense of belonging and the level of engagement in institutional orientations and affairs can be significant in some individuals and very minimal in others.

In a context where the research institution has deliverables on a tight schedule, spaces for discussion and learning are seen as an extra effort if they are not directly focused on deliverables. This makes it difficult to identify experimental action(s) of change to strengthen equality and inclusion, as is usually done in Gender Action Learning.

When the organization and its leadership do not already have a strong enough awareness of the importance of gender issues and do not create a favourable environment (free up time, create clear orientations, demonstrate personal commitment, etc.) the motivation and openness of researchers to more personal explorations of inequalities and exclusion and their transformation remain limited. Also, the e-learning process does not lend itself to more personal and informal exchanges that allow participants to share their experiences and feelings, as desired in the learning processes.

--- Page 10 ---

The demarcation between technical support and gender reflection and learning was not always clear, with the two overlapping with a "learn by doing" approach focused on research products. In such a context, the gender facilitator must already have or acquire some analytical and technical knowledge of the challenges of gender equality and inclusion in the research issue(s) and theme(s).

The involvement of a local consultant or a gender specialist as a team member was a good complement to the learning facilitation by Gender at Work because the local consultant can deepen and contextualize knowledge and learning, devote more time on site, and provide more sustained support to the research team, especially when the process takes place in virtual mode.

En quoi ce projet a-t-il contribué à un ou à plusieurs objectifs stratégiques du CRDI? Veuillez référer au Plan stratégique 2015–2020 quand le projet a été développé et mis en œuvre au cours du cycle stratégique antérieur.

The project was implemented under the 2015–2020 Strategic Plan. This project was submitted in response to the open call for proposals “Accelerating Climate Action: Social Equity and Empowerment of Women and Girls” (108870), launched March 8, 2018. It is one of seven projects selected from 499 proposals via a review process involving external experts and IDRC staff.

Invest in knowledge for positive changes

The project generated knowledge in a data-scarce area via research activities carried out in three provinces in the northeast of the Democratic Republic Congo (Bas-Uélé, Haut-Uélé, and Ituri). Research activities guided the elaboration of scientifically sound recommendations sensitive to gender challenges that are expected to benefit the whole Congo River Basin. Project generated knowledge responded to and has the potential to contribute to the Congo Country Strategic Plan (2019–2023), which calls for “Protection of the environment, access to water and sanitation, and adaptation to climate change for a better quality of life.” Furthermore, the project responds to the DRC national strategy on combating gender-based violence and its five-year national action plan, put in place in November 2012 under the leadership of the Ministry of Gender, Family and Children. These initiatives are expected to benefit 30 million people, especially high-risk populations like women.

Furthermore, the project's topics covered new thematic areas (climate change and conflicts) emanating from regions not represented in IDRC. Projects in Central Africa have been relatively rare at IDRC, despite the need to build capacity and increase awareness of gender inequalities and climate change adaptation. Therefore, the project was strategically important to IDRC and the BRACO in its efforts to extend its network, strengthen regional collaboration, build capacity, and share knowledge. Two individuals from the projects below have been invited to participate in the strategic event organized by BRACO and the responsible PO on June 28, 2022: Urgence climatique en Afrique centrale: impacts et perspectives: Une conversation autour du GIEC.

The project provided funds to train five master's students (four men and one woman) from University of Kinshasa, who have all graduated. The PO was told that only one woman applied to the scholarship. All the students were involved in the writing and are co-authors of the scientific articles. All the students now occupy positions as research assistants and/or have started a PhD because of subsequent scholarships.

The project also enhanced the capacity of a dozen CRREBaC core project team members, as described above, in gender analysis and tools, gender-differentiated impacts of climate change, and links between gender-based inequalities and climate change adaptation strategies.

## Rendement financier

Quelles sont les leçons ou les observations en lien avec le processus d'attribution, le rendement financier du projet ou l'administration du projet par le CRDI qui pourraient orienter la programmation ou les processus futurs du Centre?

The risk level of the University of Kinshasa was rated high following a review of the overall performance of this institution. In fact, several issues were noted by the PO and the GAD officer related to governance problems and financial management inefficiencies. CRREBaC must continue to improve its financial management system, especially by recruiting an experienced Administrative and Finance Officer (AFO). Currently, although the CRREBaC's financial reporting was generally timely, the Executive Director and a master's student are doing most of the work of the Centre's Accountant, who is supposed to be responsible for financial management and reporting. This led to significant confusion in each single reporting period and at project closure (still ongoing).

A two-month extension was approved for activities and costs, mainly related to dissemination of the book.

## Considérations d'ordre stratégique

Les stratégies d'atténuation des risques décrites dans le document d'approbation de projet ont-elles été efficaces? Des risques imprévus ont-ils modifié le projet?

The unanticipated risk that affected the project was:

Once the researchers from Kinshasa came back from their field work, the PI objected to sharing the primary data (quantitative survey), and their desire to collaborate with the co-proponent (UNU-INWEH) and the third parties (UNU-CRIS and Ghent University) decreased significantly—despite the proposal being submitted collaboratively. A plethora of animated discussion and calls, back and forth, had to be managed. Personal conflicts and divisions grew between the PI and co-PI during the first year of the project. The causes of the conflict were multifaceted, including gender difference, different style of communicating, and different level of seniority. This remained undetected from the outside because the two research leaders did not communicate it to IDRC immediately. In the end, the issue was not solved but was managed by a careful intervention, with the PO and Vladimir Smakhtin (Director of UNU-INWEH) playing a mediator role between both PIs. The data sharing issue became unsolvable, and timing became an issue for the PhD student, to the point that two students and three researchers eventually left the project (almost all women):

Dr Nidhi Nagabhatla (first co-PI UNU-INWEH). She was replaced by Vladimir Smakhtin, Director of UNU-INWEH.

Professor Ilse Ruyssen (Alix's advisor) assistant professor in Migration Economics at the Department of Economics of Ghent University and affiliated Research Fellow at the UNU-CRIS.

Alix Debray PhD Fellow at UNU-CRIS and Ghent University. Affiliated to the Department of Economics, she is investigating water- and climate-related conflicts and migrations towards empowerment focused solutions for policy integration in Africa. What I find quite deplorable is that Alix used the funds from her doctoral scholarship to go to Kinshasa and work with the CRREBaC team.

Professor Kenneth Yongabi Anchang Ebonyi State University, Nigeria.

Francine Nabintu Ntugulo (student Kinshasa University).

All these researchers (excepted Francine) were using their own funds. Francine finally succeeded in graduating from her master's program.

In 2020, the PO, Michele Leone (one of the co-POs), and Bruce Currie-Alder (CCP PL) regrouped and decided collectively not to close the project at that stage so as not to penalize the researchers from Kinshasa involved in the project and the students that had already started their master's degree.

Vladimir Smakhtin, Director of UNU-INWEH, took over from Nidhi as co-PI, which helped with collaboration and achieved deliverables.

I strongly recommend not funding anymore projects under Prof. Raphaël M. Tshimanga, Directeur du CRREBaC, because it goes against IDRC's value in collaborating, transparency, and there is a reputational risk for IDRC.

Y a-t-il des leçons qui découlent de l'évaluation et de la gestion de l'éthique de recherche relatives au projet? Il est possible de formuler des commentaires sur l'efficacité et la capacité du processus d'évaluation de l'éthique institutionnelle; la surveillance de l'éthique institutionnelle et de l'éthique de l'équipe de recherche tout au long du projet; la formation en éthique dans le cadre du projet; le rôle de l'équipe de programme du CRDI et du Comité consultatif sur l'éthique de la recherche, le cas échéant; les questions imprévues d'ordre éthique et la façon dont elles ont été traitées.

Approval for the study was obtained through the University of Kinshasa Ethical Board. Researchers applied ethical standards to ensure the privacy, freedom, dignity, and integrity of all participants. The main elements of the project's ethical considerations included individual consent, voluntary participation, confidentiality, and gender equity. The ethics protocol was shared with IDRC before fieldwork began.

## Observations du directeur

The PO has presented an Excellent PCR that combines the recognition of success, challenges, and lessons. As demonstrated in this PCR, IDRC made extraordinary efforts to succeed in integrating a gender framework into the program, despite the blockages on the road. The Project finalized with an extensive collection of scientific results: publications, conferences, and academic support. While the Project had not integrated from the beginning a multidisciplinary approach, with the support of several IDRC Pos the grantee ended up having a balance integration of technological solutions and social

transformation. The Project operated in a complex region surrounded by environmental stresses, in a conflict area with a high presence of migration, and in a context of poor institutional accountability.

I second the PO's remarks on the importance of supporting young and female researchers, Students in particular, in one of the planet's poorest regions. The difficulties and not always favourable relationships would not deviate from the fact that IDRC supported the studies of young women and men that will continue strengthening the research capacity of DRC.

I endorse the PO's recommendation not to fund more projects under Prof. Raphaël M. Tshimanga, Directeur du CRREBaC, due to the risk to IDRC's reputation, values, and mission. In particular, his lack of collaboration, transparency, and potential conflict of interest in his decisions.
