# Project Highlights

What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

Impact on fellows' employment and in taking up leadership roles in the water sector. The 43 fellows, all women, enrolled in the master's-level Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) programs received interdisciplinary research methods and concept training, leadership skills training, and hands-on field-based research learning and training. They were also mentored by senior researchers and given networking opportunities and internships in government, NGOs, and the private sector (e.g., UNDP, IRADe, ICLEI, IWMI, BCAS, Oxfam, IRIS). As of December 31, 2021, the fellows who had successfully completed the master's program (17 of 43) were all employed in the water-related sector as water engineers in either government organizations (6), international and national nongovernmental organizations (7), or academia (4). Of the remaining 26 fellows, 21 were still completing coursework or writing their theses and 5 were preparing their thesis defence. Some of the students have received distinctions and already demonstrate leadership in the water sector. For instance:

Khadiza Nahin and Sahika Ahmed have been selected as youth ambassadors for the OXFAM project TROSSA for the Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna basin youth network platform.

Radha Dhakal received a seed grant from the Interdisciplinary Research Institute for Sustainability (IRIS).

Manimozhi R., SAWA Fellow CWR, led the development of a WASH initiative in a rural area entitled Raising Awareness among School Students (Natrampalli, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India). To date, more than 10 schools (10 000+ students) have participated. The learning program she developed includes a play and quiz that uses cartoon characters to illustrate how Covid 19 spread due to improper sanitation. She also raised the issue of water pollution through a drawing competition. She successfully raised funds from the local authority for the prizes. See photos below.

Contribution to the body of knowledge on how an Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) approach can build resilience to the impacts of climate change using interdisciplinary research methods including gender approaches. This project contributes to a better understanding of the challenges of implementing sustainable IWRM and boosts climate resilience by demonstrating how the two are intrinsically linked and that addressing them in an integrated manner will increase the chances of success for both. The program has, to date, generated 17 master's theses, 18 peer-reviewed journal articles, 3 book chapters, 58 conference presentations and 15 published national and international conference proceedings, 18 field research reports, and 7 peer-reviewed papers on the theme of "Climate Change, Water, and Society," to be published in 2022 in a special issue of the journal Water.

Institutionalization of a core curriculum in the four engineering institutions on interdisciplinary social research methods with a focus on gender-inclusive research methods as part of the master's program. Two new courses in the social sciences are now offered by the four partner institutions. For instance, one new course focuses on how social and cultural interpretations of gender intersect with the issues of climate change and water insecurities. These courses have been integrated into the programs and will contribute to the sustainability of the SAWA leadership program. These courses are taken by both women and men, including students who were not SAWA fellows, though they are compulsory for the

follows. To deliver these new courses, the partners in the SAWA programs in the four institutions, along with other faculty members not necessarily part of SAWA, were supported to increase their capacity to integrate interdisciplinary content into their courses, work, and publications. This has been achieved through guest lectures, workshops, and targeted coaching. Such institutional change would not have been possible within the timeframe of one single program and was achieved because of the long-term collaboration (since 2005) between the institutions and SaciWATERs, particularly through capacity building programs and research projects funded by UNDP CapNET, IDRC (107240 and 106248) and the South Asian scholarship project Crossing Boundaries funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands.

Fostered South-South transboundary cooperation and partnerships between participating institutions and fellows. Regarding institutional collaborations, four memoranda of understanding were signed between the partner institutions and external organizations to undertake joint teaching and collaborative research, with some of the partnerships intended to extend beyond the project duration. In Bangladesh, the project was presented in the "Cap-Net Bangladesh core group meeting," where representatives from Bangladeshi water sector organizations were present. They have now been able to network with UNDP by permanently involving a gender expert from UNDP in the advisory committee at BUET. An internship at UNDP was also secured for one fellow per year. In India, Anna University, upon receiving the status of Centre for Excellence in IWRM, has been granted funds from the University Grants Commission, India, to the tune of 15 million INR for fieldwork, guest lectures, and infrastructure developments. The program also strengthened a network of young emerging leaders involved in research in IWRM in the four regions that stimulated South-South cooperation, thereby building research capacity in scientifically lagging countries. Strong networks among students were established and have allowed students and faculty alike to access resources beyond those available at single institutions, including co-publishing, mentoring, and research expertise. The project supported the space and time for collaboration through three intensive two-week regional workshops, one writing workshop, a research tool-shop technical workshop, guest lectures, co-publication and conference presentation opportunities, social media such as the Facebook page, etc.

Parallel funds were raised in the amount of 200,000 US$ from UNDP CapNET Network. This allowed for the provision of an additional seven scholarships and one writing workshop, increasing the original number of female fellows from 36 to 43.

Six regional workshops and eighteen collaborative presentations of field research results

Organization of three regional intensive two-week regional training workshops on interdisciplinary research methods and gender approaches, leadership skills development training (e.g., team-building sessions, communication skills and debates, application of negotiations and conflict resolution in the field), and hands-on field-based research learning and training. These workshops brought together all the fellows from each of the regions in which these collaborative networks were rooted. Through classroom and field-based teaching, these trainings covered a variety of themes and topics related to climate change vulnerability in the sensitive environments of mountainous and coastal regions, urban and peri-urban water issues, and gender and water linkages, as well as interdisciplinary field research methods and concepts and practices of interdisciplinarity. All workshops were held for around 14 days intensively. They consisted of six days of classroom learning, three days of fieldwork, and four days of data analysis. The workshops also included the coordinators, supervisors, and co-mentors to allow for

All the students got an opportunity to present during the workshop, which allowed them to build their communication and public speaking skills.

All the students from the first and second cohort had the opportunity to do hands-on field-based research learning and training.

"This workshop was very useful to practice PRA tools which I have learned in Participatory field research methodology. It has helped me to do the questionnaire survey for my thesis. It was a new and great experience for me to work and share our knowledge with other country students and to know their culture also."

SAWA Fellow, CWR, Batch 2

"Our field research group (with fellows from different countries) were able to publish abstract prepared over the research work titled "Distribution, Access and Gendered Roles of Common Property Water Resources in Bhotechaur, Nepal" at the 7th International Conference on Water and Flood Management (ICWFM) which was held in Dhaka, Bangladesh in March 2019. Furthermore, the opportunity I obtained to participate in the 7th ICWFM was also one of the outcomes I received through networking opportunities during the SAWA regional workshop."

SAWA Fellow, PGIA, Batch 1

"I haven't realized before, the importance of gender perspective in water management which I realized from this workshop. This training inspires me to develop a strong determination towards our common goal. The most beautiful moment during the program is the interaction with other SAWA fellows and supporting teachers and sharing our views and concerns which are similar across other country's water issues and research."

"The most beautiful moment during the program is the interaction with other SAWA fellows and supporting teachers and sharing our views, similar to other country's water issues and research. As part of this training workshop, we conducted small research on 'Differences in perception of Climate Change: A Case Study on Bhotechaur Village in Nepal' and we have also jointly published its abstract in the Rajarata International Research Conference, Rajarata University of Sri Lanka, Mihintale, Sri Lanka".

If appropriate, explain why outputs were not completed or were of poor quality.

Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

Although the program was designed to extend over 48 months to align the IDRC projects with academic cycles, many students have not graduated within the implementation period of the project. Only 17 of 43 fellows have graduated, mainly due to the lock down, interruptions, and delay in semesters because of the pandemic. The remaining fellows are expected to graduate by the end of December 2023. In addition, as per the university rules at PGIA and BUET, students are allowed to submit their theses within five years of the completion of their course work. Although the project coordinator has worked proactively and encouraged students to submit their theses on time, some fellows of the first cohort took an additional 9 to 12 months to submit their final thesis. That said, it was decided (before the pandemic started) to encourage students to submit their theses on time by hinging a final small lump sum to a timely submission and to provide a SAWA certificate for the completion of the program. This strategy has been effective in some cases for the first and second cohorts. Together, these measures contribute to reducing dropout rates and to giving students incentives to complete their work on time. No dropouts have been reported to date.

The PO will stay in contact with the consortium and continue to monitor the graduation of the SAWA fellows (to deliver the certificate) through the new IDRC-funded project Gendering water and climate science research in South Asia (109793). The consortium project proposal was selected through a competitive call process that included an independent expert review panel, through the call: The Gender in STEM Research Initiative - Advancing gender analysis and women's leadership in STEM fields. David O'Brien is the PO and Melanie Robertson the Co-PO.

## Project Outcomes

How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

The program was unique in that it was the first-ever attempt in the history of the four partner institutions to train fellows with an engineering and applied sciences background to familiarize themselves with various interdisciplinary research concepts and methodologies from the social sciences.

This program is an example of how long-term collaboration and a well-designed training project has multiple positive outcomes: (a) a new generation of women research professionals with interdisciplinary

--- Page 7 ---

skills, (b) an impressive body of new knowledge generated through 18 peer-reviewed journal articles and many other outputs, and (c) regional collaboration and institutional strengthening through the implementation of a core curriculum on interdisciplinary social research methodology with a focus on gender-inclusive research approaches. The program showed that these types of regional-based fellowship for training are more likely to respond to regional needs and that they succeed in retaining professionals within their home countries or regions upon graduation, thereby counteracting the commonly observed brain drain phenomenon. These outcomes achieve a highly positive cost-benefit balance. The risk of grant-based training programs is that they end up with a scattered, uncoordinated set of research themes. However, this program has successfully maintained a focus over the long term.

These are the key results:

Gender imbalance in water-related research in the four institutions is redressed by women being promoted as beneficiaries of the project

Women were the funding priority for the proposed phase of the program, with 100% of the fellowships being awarded to women. The priority is thus to redress the gender imbalance in water-related research, including the attendant job market and policymaking domain, and to create a body of women water professionals trained in IWRM to address the impact of climate change. While women made up 29% and 25% of the researchers in the Humanities and Social Sciences, respectively, their representation is lowest in the fields of Earth and Planetary Sciences (16%) and Engineering (15%; British Council 2015). Water and climate sciences and engineering appear most acutely challenged by gender disparities, which seem to be at the heart of these fields. Gender inclusion in IWRM research and training is particularly limited in the context of South Asia due to its traditional gender relations, low prioritization of women's education, and gender disparities in the workforce and the workplace.

Women's position at the intersection of class, caste, religion, and other axes of social differentiation create further disparities in access to education and employment. According to the partners involved, the pandemic has also deepened this divide because of an existing gender divide in access to digital infrastructure, which became crucial to enabling continuity in education.

A pool of trained interdisciplinary water professionals and faculty members

It is expected that graduates will: (a) assume leadership within their institution, country, and region to carry forward the ideologies of IWRM and to act as agents of change in creating a paradigm shift in higher education regarding how the topic of water resources in South Asia is researched and taught; and (b) translate interdisciplinary learning into problem-solving approaches that will contribute to the welfare of women and other marginalized groups of society.

Integration of gender and social inclusion in research and capacity building through interdisciplinary mentorship

While gender-inclusive participation in science education is a challenge, it is yet to be seen if more gender inclusivity improves gender analysis in IWRM and climate change research. Based on the lessons learned from the previous phase (SAWA 108441), inclusion of women (particularly as trainees) does not automatically confer gender sensitivity or gender transformative potential to a training program. For this phase, a stronger training component for the trainers of fellows' supervisors, both women and men (that have an engineering or science-based background) and of curriculum development for all students (SAWA and non-SAWA) was successfully added to enhance gender outcomes. Furthermore, each grantee was assigned a senior mentor professor with interdisciplinary research experience, including on gender. During the regional workshops, fellows also presented their research to gender experts who provided feedback to grantees with regard to incorporating the interdisciplinary and gender lens in their research. In this way, gender was better incorporated as a crosscutting theme in the fellows' research.

Education in IWRM and gender issues also helped fellows transition from technocratic thinking about the water and climate change sectors to greater appreciation of the social causes and impacts of climatic and environmental changes. It brought more sensitivity towards environmental injustice and the complexity of sustainable solutions to water issues.

Despite all these efforts, the gender focus in their research varied across outputs. Only 8 of the 17 fellows' theses had a core focus on gender water linkages, which is reflected in their titles. However, all other fellows have adopted a gender lens as an intersectional aspect, producing gender aggregated data and results along with other axes of inequality and vulnerability. Gender narratives, in-depth interviews, time use surveys, and gender disaggregated quantitative household and individual surveys were the most prominent methods used to incorporate gender in their IWRM research. For many fellows "gender" as a concept was entirely novel, especially in linkage with IWRM and climate change. This has successfully introduced gender as a lens of interdisciplinary research in their theses.

We can say that gender continues to be a complex concept for most fellows as well as faculty members and supervisors despite the intensive training, varied methods of training, and mentorship implemented. This reflects the stringent disciplinary boundaries—their language, underlying principles and priority lenses, and methods—which are further institutionalized in the four engineering institutions' systems thus requiring more systemic changes and a longer-term vision.

"During my interview, I expressed that I wanted to join a structures-based engineering program but when they asked me the favourite course in the current semester, I replied to Hydrology. I never knew that the subjects on gender &amp; water, legal aspects of water, participatory field research methodology, and climate change are going to create an alternative impact on my views I had so far on water. While getting the knowledge on these. I got angry about society and its poor functioning. There were a lot of questions raised in my mind such as 1) where it failed to manage? and 2) why it's just like this?"

SAWA Fellow, CWR, Batch 2

"The most important subject which touched my heart was to understand the link between gender and water. I studied so many case studies from different countries. It was really an eye-opener for me to understand gender equality. It gave a big impact on my personal life also. Now I felt that I am the one

--- Page 9 ---

who is always against gender discrimination in my family."

SAWA Fellow, CWR, Batch 1

"Along with the technical aspect, I have researched women's intersectionality impact and their gender mainstreaming in three communities of Khairahani Municipality of East Rapti watershed. This gender analysis helped me to understand that women are not a single entity, not a homogeneous group but it is a heterogeneous group, we should not define women's impact in one group but there is a need to understand the impact within a different category for women. The research journey makes me more curious and I want to explore more on the water sector and gender."

SAWA Fellow, NEC, Batch 1

"Now I am working in the governmental institution, which is the policy making organization. During the policy making time I will suggest to include the gender."

SAWA Fellow, NEC, Batch 1

Largely demonstrable efficacy of the holistic IWRM approach with respect to the impact of climate change on water resources

This is demonstrated through, among other things, fellows' Master's theses, peer-reviewed articles, and book chapters. The program generated a body of knowledge in South Asia that offers a better understanding of how the IWRM approach can contribute to building resilience to the impacts of climate change. Although IWRM is widely accepted, it is rarely implemented in South Asia, in part because there are gaps in the knowledge base on water. The paradigm in water resources education programs focused primarily on engineering and hydrology, with less attention being paid to the challenges of poverty reduction, livelihood insecurity, and gender. See Annex 1 of the FTR for all the thesis titles.

The strengthening of four engineering institutions by longer-term regional collaboration and institutionalization of a common curriculum on interdisciplinary social research methodology with a focus on gender

The four institutions have become better known for the integration of interdisciplinary methods in their curriculum. The number of students that applied for this program has increased over time and the institutions have received progressively bigger interdisciplinary research grants and partnerships. Good examples are the three memoranda of understanding that were signed between some of the partner institutions and external organizations: (a) IWRM program at NEC signed a memorandum of understanding with the Water and Energy Commission Secretariat (WECS); (b) CWR signed a memorandum of understanding with the Water Resource Department and Irrigation Management Training Institute; and (c) PGIA signed a memorandum of understanding with the Agriculture Department, Department of Irrigation, Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka. Finally, CWR received the status of Centre for Excellence in IWRM from the University Grants Commission, India, to the tune of 10 million INR for fieldwork, guest lectures, and program developments.

Unique leadership components facilitated emerging researchers to take leadership roles in different organizations

The challenge in developing this second phase of the program was to incorporate a leadership component (as opposed to simply "capacity building"). The new leadership component of the program

--- Page 10 ---

drew on lessons learned from the synthesis written by Mélanie Robertson entitled . The synthesis included: the dominant themes and examples of good practice that emerged from Climate Change and IDRC's experience, the key ingredients for building leaders in research for development, a thorough review of the literature on building leaders in research for development and relevant programs, as well as experiences from other agencies. The synthesis also considered outputs from discussions held in 2015 by a Working Group composed of IDRC staff involved in and related to leader-building work (Jigsaw Consult 2015 - IDRC).

To facilitate more fellows' transitions to leadership roles, the program included leadership skills development through activities such as team-building sessions, mentorship, communication skills, and application of negotiation and conflict resolution in the field. For instance, one fellow has taken on a leadership position as the director of the Centre for Water Resources in Chennai. The same fellow has also been nominated to participate in many higher-level committees at the national and state levels, is a member of the executive committee of the Regional Deltaic Research Centre at the National Institute of Hydrology and of the Governing Council of Irrigation Management Training Institute, Government of Tamil Nadu, and was, in the past, an expert member of Applet Form on illegal sand mining in river basins in Tamil Nadu and a member of a committee for the internationalization of higher education in Tamil Nadu.

There is no doubt that the SAWA program has had an impact on grantees' employment and that it has helped them assume leadership roles. Many of the graduates are in positions of leadership, including as academics and policymakers. Furthermore, SaciWATERs observed that the percentage of SAWA students employed in the government sector is higher than that of non-SAWA students, meaning that SAWA serves as a means through which interdisciplinary approaches can be introduced into government action plans. Another major observation is that the number of students still working on theses is very high for non-SAWA fellows as compared to SAWA fellows. The rate of employment of SAWA students in academic and research organizations is also higher than that of non-SAWA students. Finally, out of the 43 SAWA fellows, two are pursuing PhDs abroad and one is pursuing higher studies in Bangladesh while, out of 81 non-SAWA students, only one is pursuing higher studies. SAWA fellows are now employed as engineers. For instance:

in the government sector (e.g., Ministry of Energy, Nepal; Water Resources Department under the Tamil Nadu Public Works Department; the Bangladesh Water Development Board; the Department of Agricultural Extension of the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh)

in NGOs (e.g. NeuroLandscape; National Agro Foundation; People in Need; Center of Research for Environment, Energy and Water [CREEW])

in the private sector (e.g. Darashaw &amp; Co. Pvt. Ltd., Chennai; Sri Infrastructure And Water Environics Consultants [Opc])

as assistant professors and lecturers (e.g., Khulna University, Bangladesh; Department of Agricultural Engineering, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka; Rajarata University of Sri Lanka)

as research associates (e.g., International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, ICIMOD; DST INSPIRE, Centre for Water Resources, Anna University; Tamilnadu Consumer Protection Environmental Research Centre)

One fellow received scholarships to pursue a PhD at the World University of Bangladesh (WUB).

Authentic work environments that linked fellows to actual decisions and applications within the communities they engage with increased the fellow's employment rate

One critique of the first phase of the SAWA program was that it was off-site and not sufficiently embedded in any real work environment. The main criticism from the literature is that leadership programs tend to have too much of a skills-based approach and that they lack contextualization. Thus, to create contexts in which fellows are more likely to engage in research that will have practical impacts, the program, with the help of the PO, organized internships through collaborations with government, NGOs, and the private sector. This component provided an authentic work environment, and though it was extremely labour intensive for IDRC and SaciWATERs, overall it has been extremely successful with surprisingly high up-take on the part of organizations, who frequently even proposed a stipend for the fellow. This component increased employment rates for fellows soon after the completion of their master's degree. Exposure to the sector through internships was successful in building sectoral linkages and professional networks that provided a leverage for increasing the number of women professionals in the water sector. Internship opportunities provided fellows ground experience in action research and implementation on varied themes of global and regional concern and priority, helping them to understand the sector—its market, practice, and internal decision-making processes. The internship organizations were:

"SAWA fellowship program gave me an opportunity to work as an intern at ICLEI South Asia, New Delhi, for a month. In my internship, I worked on reviewing the successful case studies on Nature-Based Solutions. While reading and compiling the case studies for the report, I realized the role of nature on sustainable development and its ability to provide applicable solutions for real-world

problems. These two events (inclusion fieldwork training in regional training workshop) enhanced my skills. My thought and idea of approaching a problem or perceiving a situation became different. I started to think holistically."

SAWA Fellow, CWR, Batch 1

New selection criteria institutionalized in at least two of the four engineering institutions

One important aspect of building leadership is identifying the people that have leadership potential. As a result, the selection process of any leadership program—standalone or integrated—was of extreme importance, maybe as important as the program itself.

One novel aspect in this phase was that the selection was not based solely on academic talent, as in the first phase of SAWA (e.g., bachelor's in engineering, good grades and good results in the entrance exam). The fellows had to write an essay and take part in interviews in which they were asked to provide a rationale and demonstrate a clear vision of what they want to accomplish after completion of the leadership program. That rationale and vision included a strategy for reaching that objective, an explanation of how that will contribute to their career, and a commitment to giving back to the communities with which they are engaging. The selection committee was appointed by the university Vice Chancellor and consisted of professors, external water experts, and a representative from SaciWATERs.

Strengthened alumni network

The four partner institutions have continually monitored the awardees of the Crossing Boundaries (2005–2011) and SAWA phase I (2013–2016) programs and now SAWA phase II. An alumni network has been established, comprising over 240 fellows, over 20 supervisors (who have supervised fellows), and approximately 15 institutions. A tracer study has been conducted annually to track their career trajectories, experiences, and achievements. These studies have shown the kind of leadership roles assumed by the awardees in the policy, research, and academic arenas in South Asia. For the SAWA fellowship, SaciWATERs as well as the partner institutions have been able to monitor the awardees of the first and second cohort, and they will do so for the last two cohorts of students who have yet to graduate and in the proposed phase. SaciWATERs has also taken responsibility for building an online network of all the SAWA fellowship awardees. This network, currently maintained with a Google group and a Facebook group, is being utilized in a number of ways not only to encourage the participants to publish their research in the form of papers in refereed journals and blogs but also to track their career trajectories. Apart from the fellowship awardees, SaciWATERs and the partner institutions have also been active in monitoring the alumni of the IWRM program to evaluate the larger impact such interdisciplinary programs are having in South Asia.

How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

One of the most valued outcomes of the SAWA program for many fellows was the opportunity it provided for building relationships, mentorship and peer networks, and exposure to the water sector through internships. However, this strength was significantly limited during the last year and a half by the restrictions of the COVID pandemic. The team and fellows have adapted very well to the situation

and quickly redesigned some components the program. Yet it also offered new opportunities for the fellows and for developing novel and innovative methods for implementing the program activities:

Not constrained by travel costs, more fellows were encouraged and supported to attend more virtual conferences, special panels, etc.

Virtual workshops were redesigned (3rd regional training workshop and research tool-shop workshop) with deep considerations for the limits of online participation and learning. Trainings were designed around differing time schedules and the academic calendars of universities, offering a period of concentration for fellows and innovative modes of group engagement and practical learning, and made it easier for the PIs to reach out to a wider group of students who could benefit from the trainings.

The working paper series for SAWA fellows on the theme of "Climate Change, Water, and Society" was initiated in March 2021 with the intent to promote scientific writing by offering fellows a writing workshop and two rounds of reviews. The funds originally allocated for travel were used to develop a SAWA paper series. Fellows were encouraged to write jointly with other fellows and at least one senior researcher. Seven working papers were submitted to the series, providing a forum for the SAWA fellows to disseminate their interdisciplinary research on the complex relationships between water and climate change and their socially differentiated impacts based on field research conducted during the three regional training workshops. SAWA fellows were encouraged to integrate their learnings on gender and water and interdisciplinary field research methodology trainings in the SAWA program. They were encouraged to juxtapose some of the concepts and theories that emerged from the training programs with their empirical material and to consider their research in a comparative perspective, highlighting the rationale for comparison, but also bringing out important similarities and differences across the cases. These papers were all presented by a cross-country team of fellows at national and international conferences and will be published in the special issue of Water.

How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy. Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

The project was conceived in response to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan.

For SO1 (knowledge and innovation for large-scale positive change), the project managed to generate new knowledge in the field of IWRM. Some of the fellows developed innovative solutions; for example, a study carried out in Sri Lanka highlighted that water distribution in the tail reaches rather than the head reaches of the canal system offers new insights into how an irrigation system may work in humid regions. A study conducted in India that demonstrated that non-system tanks are actually more efficient than cascade tanks has great relevance for the large-scale implementation of tank rejuvenation programs in other parts of the country. Some of the findings move away from the commonly established understanding of water resources.

For SO2 (leaders for today and tomorrow), IDRC had set itself the goal to have, by 2020, identified and supported at least 500 individuals with leadership potential through grants and fellowships and to have assisted at least 50 organizations in making progress in their fields (Strategic Plan 2015-2020, p. 6). The program contributed to meeting these targets. The program also contributed to meeting IDRC targets by strengthening the four academic institutions involved through the implementation of a

common curriculum on interdisciplinary social research methodology with a focus on gender and by providing trainings on said methodology for established faculty members.

## Financial performance

--- Page 15 ---

Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC’s administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

Due to national policies for non-governmental organizations in India, SaciWATERs was not permitted to transfer funds outside India. Therefore, for the transfer of funds, SaciWATERs and three of the PIs signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with IDRC. Only the funds for CWR (Anna University, India) were transferred through SaciWATERs. On a half-yearly basis, each of the partners submitted a financial report to IDRC separately, which considerably increased the workload of the Grant Administrators and the PO. The plan for SaciWATERs was to open an office in Nepal as an international organization operating under Nepali laws and regulations. Once the Nepal office was set up, SaciWATERs intended to implement the project from that office, facilitating the receipt of money from Nepal. However, given the current political changes in India, this did not happen during the timeframe of this program.

The PAD highlighted that regional collaboration constituted risks to financial coordination and continuity in training activities. In fact, funding four institutions while conducting the project, with SaciWATERs acting as project coordinators, proved useful and efficient. Having SaciWATERs as a project coordinator facilitated management, communication, and exchanges between IDRC and the four institutions and the fellows. SaciWATERs is central to the planning and monitoring of all project-related activities such as regional workshops, interdisciplinary research mentorships, internships, and technical reporting in consultation with the PIs and IDRC. SaciWATERs has frequently found itself conducting a sort of “translation” between partners, bridging gaps between administrative models and facilitating communication. SaciWATERs’s role as translator and mediator was also important to the production of technical and financial reports, the completion of international dissemination activities, and the facilitation of exchanges between fellows in the region. I believe this structure provided several advantages to IDRC. It certainly provided added value to all SAWA partners and fellows.

The value-for-money question for the program is strong considering that the approaches, collaborations, and curricula will continue to be used after IDRC withdraws through the institutionalization of the core curriculum in addition to the 43 trained young researchers. In the opinion of the PO, continued support of this kind of program and capitalizing on well-established capacity building programs is crucial. It provides IDRC with the opportunity to have a direct impact on the capacity of young researchers within their own local context. Nevertheless, it would be advisable to assess the “no-regrets” benefits of this model of training projects more carefully as opposed to a more policy impact focus. These programs rapidly produced a broad set of knowledge and trained a large group of people to be ready to pursue careers in the academy or public sector. On the other hand, the direct application of the research to policy and practice and follow up on its impact and the scalability is less evident.

One point of consideration when developing these programs in the future is that they are time consuming for the PO. While being on thesis committees, finding internships, being a mentor, and acting as a resource person during the regional trainings workshop was rich and rewarding work that I have enjoyed immensely, the commitments might have been too much.

## Strategic Considerations

--- Page 16 ---

Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

Yes, overall, the risk mitigation was effective, and all lessons learned from the previous phase were integrated. However, I observed two challenges for which there were no mitigation strategies in the PAD:

The loss of the PI, Prof. Sucharita Sen, the Executive Director (ED) of SaciWATERs, who returned to her attached university, was a major loss for the project. Professor Sen researches the gender and societal aspects of climate change and was an ardent supporter of the fellowship program. She played an important role in improving the program's gender focus. However, Prof. Sen stayed in the program by becoming a senior mentor for the fellows in India. Between 2018 and 2021, SaciWATERs changed its ED four times. The extra work due to the high rotation was greatly minimized by the supporting staff from SaciWATERs.

Some fellows have reported delays in degrees and thesis submissions because of personal constraints that often reflect the gendered challenges women face in higher education due to traditional gender relations around marriage, maternity, childcare, and relocation for their spouses/partners. The gender relations in South Asia and the burdens it imposes on women professionals and scholars were understood and empathized with. Flexibility was maintained in the project to ensure that fellows facing marital, maternity, and childcare responsibilities are not disincentivized in the project and are more supported both financially and intellectually for their research and professional development. Additional support has been provided to fellows facing these constraints with certain timeline flexibility, additional meetings and support for research mentorship, childcare support at trainings, and encouragement to progress and submit through joint review meetings to keep them connected and motivated in their ongoing research work.

"I was expecting my first baby when I was selected for SAWA. It was only the 3rd month of my pregnancy, and I was not very sure if I would be allowed to carry the fellowship under SAWA. SAWA is a big platform, and I was interested to carry on. The SAWA committee allowed and encouraged me to continue. I missed the training session with my SAWA batchmates held in Nepal but instead was given the opportunity to attend the session next year in Chennai, India instead. It has been a memorable journey to become a mother, carrying the baby to field survey, attending training sessions in India, completing the thesis, completing the degree and finally finding a job. I am thankful to the SAWA committee and Melanie (IDRC) for their always extended hand and support throughout the entire journey!" SAWA Fellows, BUET, Batch 1

Finally, a recurrent challenge for IDRC in these capacity building and leadership programs is the challenge of effectively measuring the impact of initiatives to build leaders within the timeframe of a program. There is a demand for measurable outputs (such as publication quotas) over leadership development. However, it is inherently challenging to validate leadership activities on the basis of quantitative metrics. There are multiple examples and anecdotal accounts of individuals who were supported by or associated with IDRC many years ago and who have since become highly influential and leading figures within their sector/nation. At present, it is only by chance that IDRC finds out that someone who has had input from IDRC has gone on to excel in their leadership trajectory. The Centre seems to continually hear of such cases, for example, that the minister of some country was an IDRC PhD grantee, but such findings are all incidental and anecdotal. Indeed, supporting and encouraging

--- Page 17 ---

high-capacity individuals in taking up significant leadership roles is a part of IDRC's story and heritage. There are multiple reasons why long-term tracking is challenging within any organization, but one important constraint is that the current input of resources will not manifest benefits until the distant future, and this tracking period is longer than the institutional memory within the organization. Going back to old programs and establishing "what happened through this investment 15 years ago" is not currently possible. Some effort has been made to conduct tracer studies of past fellows; however, these are not always a systematic part of the program's larger strategy.

In light of this, CRFS might consider beginning a MEL template that enables a light-weight, systematic tracking of the progress of individuals over the long term (10 years). IDRC Working Group discussions culminated in the suggestion that the evaluation of these activities should focus on contribution rather than attribution and establish a narrative-based understanding of what takes place and how IDRC inputs contributed. This would involve "telling the story" and monitoring what they are now doing and whether they attribute any of their current accomplishments to the input they received from IDRC.

Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project?

You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

There were no issues related to research ethics. Ethical issues were negotiated by the fellows and their respective supervisors and institutions before commencement of the fellowship. The issue of ethical oversight and ensuring that the standards set by the respective institutions are met was the responsibility of the fellows' home and host institution's supervisors.

At the regional workshops, the fellows come from different cultures and are therefore subject to different ethical norms. The project ensures that each of their cultures is respected and that a comfortable learning environment is created for them.

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

Supporting leaders in the climate change arena is not only a priority for IDRC but one of the recommendations from IPCC in many regions. SAWA addressed this issue by empowering women and integrating gender approaches, resilience frameworks, and technological solutions. The PO has presented in this PCR an all-encompassing series of examples and lessons that summarize over four years of noteworthy capacity-building intervention.

As presented by the PO, IDRC has an opportunity to learn about the project cycle of capacity-building initiatives to ensure timelines are realistic with academic processes and students' realities. As IDRC continues supporting women, indigenous groups, youth, and other underrepresented groups, the Center needs to be flexible with the individual facts while aligning with Grant's limitations.

In Asia future initiatives should learn from the lessons this PCR reflects. As CRFS defines the next generation of projects in the region, SAWA-PCR should be a must-read for anyone operating and designing Capacity Strengthening projects on Climate Change.
