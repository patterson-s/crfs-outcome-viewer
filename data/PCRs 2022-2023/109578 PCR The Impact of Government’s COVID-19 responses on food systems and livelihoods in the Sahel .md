# PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

The project surveyed extensively the perceived impacts of policy responses to the covid-19 pandemics in the five countries of study. To do so, it assembled a rich database of both impacts of national policies and on those of regional policies in each country. The database is mixed quantitative (households' survey data) and qualitative (key informants' interviews), and it spans across different impact domains. IDRC is discussing with CORAF the opportunity to make the data publicly available, for further analysis and studies.

The data and their following statistical analysis led to a ranking of the main positive and negative effects of covid public response policies, allowing to a certain degree to compare how similar measures had different effects depending on contexts, but also which measures were consistently detrimental to livelihoods and food security, and which ones were consistently beneficial.

For instance, according to the project the results of the surveys seem to show that that free distribution of vaccines has not been so far perceived as having a positive effect on livelihoods, while emergency cash and food distribution emerged as a highly effective measure in Cape Verde, but not in Burkina Faso nor Mali. Instead, in those two countries cash transfers were considered as mildly negative, for reasons to be further explored, while food distribution to livestock was considered more effective than direct food aid to people in households.

The policies analysed were mostly at the national and regional level. However, the large number of survey data allowed some local disaggregation and showed that removal of quarantines had positive perceived effects both in areas with high and low covid incidence and mortality.

In general, a pattern emerged from data that suggests that measures that allowed to "protect" existing livelihoods, job types, and existing life habits were considered positive. On the contrary, measures that disrupted such patterns as aimed to "transform" the system, were considered negatively even when implemented to mitigate the effect of quarantines, or to provide immediate aid and relief. This was also largely uncorrelated with the origin of aim (government, private sector, diaspora, international aid community and NGOs).

This is not fully surprising, because people resist to transformation and rely on protection of existing systems even in case of emergency. But it is precious knowledge, because it can guide future measures, the way they are communicated (maybe not as "emergency" but as "continuity" interventions), and the way they are perceived. This may be applicable to other domains, such as a potential luring food prices crisis due to the war in Europe, or to climate related disaster risk reduction interventions in the region.

In all countries, the easing of the quarantine measures was perceived and as having a positive impact, irrespectively of when and how it was done (during a specific epidemic wave or in between waves, early in the pandemic or later, for the first time or recurrently, limited to some openings or unrestricted). The vice-versa is also true, showing that the perceived negative impacts of quarantines were consistently larger than the negative impacts of the disease itself.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that market closures have had a larger impact of food security than the direct consequences of the pandemic. This project adds some evidence in this direction. However, due to the limited reliability on real covid infection and mortality rates, and because the project results have been largely based on perception of interviewees, rather than systematic measurements of food

security and livelihoods indicators, it is hard to distill specific recommendations moving forward.

## Main Outputs

Research Outputs – A part form the final technical reports and the reports of the restitution workshops (filed), the main outputs so far have been the five national reports with the data analysis of the impacts of the covid-19 contained measures on livelihoods. Data are gender disaggregated. CORAF is working at a scientific publication, but they have not yet had time to finalize it.

- National Report – Mali
- National Report – Burkina Faso
- National Report – Senegal
- National Report – Niger
- National Report Cape Verde

Knowledge Sharing and Media Coverage – The project was featured in videos broadcasted by Malian national media:

- Video 1
- Video 2
- Video 3

In the five countries, there was a good national media coverage, whose main links can be found here: Project Medias Coverage

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area? Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

As explained in the rationale for the whole IDRC AFS covid-19 rapid response initiative, this project was solicited by the Centre via a Call by invitation. The research proposed responded to an urgent need elicited by the anecdotic evidence of the negative impacts on food security of containment measures of the pandemic in already fragile countries.

Despite the importance of the main findings (see section above), the project faced challenges that limited its ability to fully produce all the envisioned results.

Given the tight timelines under which this work was conducted, the PO identified the following challenges:

- The project team was unprepared to start data collection immediately after the signature of the grant agreement. While IDRC was convinced that CORAF had started activities, the organization used ~30% of the time available to hire consultants.
- The committee who reviewed the proposal overestimated the GEI expertise of the project team. In fact, only the PI possessed that expertise, and she was marginally involved in the design of the data collection protocols.

--- Page 2 ---

There were delays in the interim reports, which prevented form correcting the course of the project, given the short duration of the contract.

The data analysis did not go beyond the level of simple descriptive statistics. Results were presented in numerous fora and with policy makers and media resonance, but there was little discussion of their significance, and of what alternatives authorities may have had.

CORAF emerged by the project as challenged also in its primary role of knowledge broker: an in-depth study of their website and their presence in the news, social networks, and references publicly available reports – conducted remotely by the PO in parallel to the project activities - showed that CORAF's publication database seems to be dysfunctional, that very few publications were produced since 2019, that most of their large projects – where CORAF had a coordinated role – ended in 2019, and that there is no sign of the covid-19 related work posted on their website. Finally, most of the recent news pointing to CORAF's activities have been around funding announcements, rather than on results and the way these results were used.

These factors were at least partially responsible for the following limitations in the results:

- Unclear differences between perceived and measured impacts of covid-19 response measures on food systems in the five countries of study.
- Little systematization in the way policies were tested across countries.
- Only basics descriptive statistics without a clear attempt to distill the significance of the produced knowledge.
- Lack of discussion on the robustness of the ranking used to assess the covid-19 response measures

How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

No peer reviewed publication nor other kind of public facing relevant output was finalized by the team before the end of the project.

Despite this, CORAF made their results available to Food Systems Foresight, contributing to the imitative-level synthesis report. This synthesis work has contributed responds to the Centre's corporate communications priority on covid-19 for Fiscal Year 2021-2022.

This table summarizes the envisioned results contained in the project proposals, with the color code indicating the level of achievement, according to the PO analysis (green = good, yellow = medium, red = poor):

- At the onset, CORAF stated that they would "use their mainstream communication channels within the ECOWAS for dissemination" (from proposal). They would also "share results among a network of think tanks (with the help of IPAR) and among the other projects of the COVID-AFS initiative of IDRC" (from proposal). This was done with IDRC, but as of today we have little evidence on how results were shared with African think tanks.

- Looking back on this project, did any important lessons for IDRC arise related to supporting future work?

The impossibility to meet CORAF before approving the grant and then to and conduct field visits to check the validity of the claims on the capacity and readiness of the team had an important impact on

the results of the work.

CORAF was unprepared to lead a fast response, one year long project: it emerged after a few months that the team had taken for granted that a no-cost extension would be given. This cast some doubts on their level of the understanding of the urgency of the work, but also on IDRC assumption that we could always hire our usual partners, accustomed to projects of durations of ~3 years, for a work of radically different nature.

CORAF had to move in a very competitive space of organizations like IFPRI and other northern led organizations that had started similar analysis with internal funds by the time the grant was disbursed. Some other organizations supported by the same AFS-covid initiative felt this competition to a lesser extent, possibly because:

- The scope of their work was smaller (national level, focus on informal sector only, analysis of specific responses without the need to create new data from scratch)
- Their work had a smaller overlap with that of northern based organizations
- How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

This project was part of a very specific initiative of the Agriculture and Food Security programme, aiming to generate timely knowledge to inform Southern government to better respond to the covid-19 pandemics, and draw lessons for future emergencies. More broadly, this initiative was part of IDRC's investment of nearly $55 million in COVID-19 research projects, in more than 65 countries, from its parliamentary appropriation. More than 60 IDRC-supported research projects have been studying the impact of the pandemic and developing and testing effective interventions.

Although being launched before the announcement of IDRC's Strategy2030, the project was in line with two of the three objectives of the Strategy: to invest in high-quality research and innovation in developing countries; and to expands knowledge sharing for greater uptake and use to increase the reach of the research.

The project contributed modestly to the first objective, because it failed to generate non-obvious results, and at the same was not designed to collect robust and unequivocable data confirming common sense intuition.

However, the findings came out rather quickly, and could be used in the synthesis work led by IDRC. The project therefore has been contributing to the second objective linked to knowledge sharing and outreach, but it is fair to say that this has largely been thanks to additional knowledge sharing funds and activities not led by CORAF.

The project Principal Investigator was also invited by IDRC to present the main findings of the project in two virtual seminars – one dedicated to science to policy dialogues and one to knowledge sharing among the francophone research community. It is unclear how CORAF – independently – has been using the results and plans to use them in the immediate future now that the project has closed. The PO has planned a discussion with them to clarify these points.

## Gender Equality and Social Inclusion

Gender responsiveness was well described in the objectives of the proposal. The project principal investigator has a track record of work on Gender Equity and Inclusion (GEI), and she has been the

--- Page 4 ---

CORAF GEI Regional Adviser since 2012. These were some of the reasons that convinced the review panel to select this idea for funding.

However, at the stage of project implementation, attention to gender was only given via data disaggregation. The results confirmed anecdotic evidence and showed that women were in general more vulnerable to covid-19 response measures than men, but they were not robust quantitatively, and there was little discussion on the root causes of this differential impact.

A series of discussions between the PO and CORAF before and after the project closure highlighted the fact that the organization's executive and research team is much smaller than expected (in general, not limited to this specific project), it relies heavily on consultants hired for individual projects, and it is spread thinly across many countries of focus. For projects with duration of one year, the recruitment process of consultants lasted months, eroding an important percentage of the time available. This was particularly true in the case of the hiring of consultants with GEI knowledge, which are not many in the region. The data collection process also had some original flaws since was probably designed before GEI-knowledgeable consultants were hired.

On a positive note, the interviews with key informants included a rich variety of individuals, both in terms of gender and social background.

## IDRC's development outcomes

Working in countries that are also vulnerable to climate change and have fragile governance systems (Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso), the project generated knowledge on how policies can have an immediate impact on the health and resilience of food systems and livelihoods, and their actors. In doing so, the project aspired to contribute to the development outcomes of the CRFS and the DIG divisions in particular:

- CRFS: Communities living in climate change hot spots are more resilient and have healthy diets because of improved access to more sustainable and inclusive food systems.
- DIG: Vulnerable people and communities benefit from more inclusive, accountable, and transparent governance. They are better able to shape the policies and practices that affect their lives by exercising their democratic rights and freedoms, including in contexts of democratic transition and displacement

Measurable contributions are still possible, but they will depend on the efforts to polish the results and communicate them with the networks of stakeholders reachable by CORAF.

## OBJECTIVES

### Meeting Project Objectives

General Objective: to contribute to improving gender-sensitive food and nutrition security in the Sahelian zone of West Africa region against physical and biological shocks, particularly the COVID-19 and future pandemics.

- 4 Fully met
- 3 X 2
- 1 Not met

Since the project met only one out of three specific objectives at an acceptable level, there is not yet evidence of its positive contribution to food and nutrition security in the region. Things can change depending on the capacity of the team to revisit the data analysis, the details of the national studies,

--- Page 5 ---

and the way they will be shared and discussed with stakeholders.

Specific Objective 1: Take stock of government responses and determine their impact on food production, availability, access, and coping mechanisms;

■ 4 Fully met X 3 ■2 ■1 Not met

This objective was met better than the other ones, as the project contributed to a rich data base of policy impacts, was able to review almost all known official covid-19 response measures in all five countries and was able to compare their effectiveness across countries. It did not generate unexpected results, but reinforced hypotheses on what were the factors contributing more strongly to the weakening of livelihoods. Data on the impacts on food production were more scarce than ones on availability and access.

Specific Objective 2: Identify gaps in government's COVID-19 responses including gender inequality for improved preparedness to manage future pandemics;

■ 4 Fully met ■ 3 X 2 ■1 Not met

Some gaps were identified, but the data analysis failed to clarify if the reported impacts of covid-19 containment measures were real or perceived, or an overlap of the two. Also, some reported impacts show apparent inconsistencies, which may be resolved in a more in-depth study which could not be done withing the life of the project. Without resolving these issues at the data analysis level, it is hard to identify specific gaps or opportunities for improvement of future responses.

Specific Objective 3: Propose policy considerations for managing disaster and risk reduction in the future.

■ 4 Fully met ■ 3 ■ 2 X 1 Not met

Objective 3 was largely ignored by the team. The project struggled with the data collection and basic statistical analysis, due to lack of time and some original design flaws in the survey, which were not communicated to the PO. Interim reports were late – with CORAF claiming having misunderstood the milestone timelines of the grant agreement. However, country level reports are very rich of data and other initiative working on crises in the Sahel, and with a more regular open communication channels with decision makers, will be able to access them.

Apart from traditional restitution workshops held in the five countries, the project final report did not include any specific suggestions nor plans to communicate results to governments.

## FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

The recipient was slow and assumed an extension would be granted despite strong messages from the IDRC PO that stated that this was not going to be possible.

Most of the money was allocated up front. As happened in the past, this decreased the leverage power of IDRC. Maybe a consultancy type contract – pay at delivery – would have been better in this case.

# STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project?

No: mostly data via remote interviews or analysis of secondary data. Most of the work was done remotely.

However, we do not yet know how data and results will be used by CORAF. The results are interesting but not solid nor rigorous. Using them assuming they are robust, as CORAF may be tempted to do, may pose ethical problems.

## Director comments

The relevant Program or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

Comprehensive and presented in a reader-friendly manner, the PCR offers valuable insights on the project by identifying challenges and possible factors. Given the different context and nature of Stream 2 projects compared to IDRC’s usual modus operandi and portfolio (shorter project duration, focus on urgent/novel issues, remote relationship with partners from project design to monitoring, restrictions to in-person engagements for partners), it provides critical learnings and should be referenced for future initiatives, particularly regarding risks and associated mitigation strategies, as well as in the broader context of IDRC’s assessment of its business model. For the region, it underlines the importance of increasing the pool of potential partners, and the necessity to undertake a constant monitoring of current institutional capacities and working methods.

## Action Items / Next Steps

After this project, CORAF participated in another closed call for proposals in the Framework of the CRFS initiative of agroecology in francophone west Africa. Their proposal was considerably weak and below expectations. It was not retained for funding.

## To do:

- Visit CORAF in person as soon as it becomes again possible, to discuss the constraints of this work in a face-to-face meeting.
- Participate in the meetings of the CORAF’s group of donors, to exchange intelligence on the organization’s recent performance.
