# Project Abstract

The nutrition transition in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) is characterized by having over 50% of the region's adult population overweight and 23% obese, primarily as a result of a steady increase in consumption of ultra-processed food including high levels of fat, sugar and salt. In the last 40 years, children's obesity worldwide has increased ten-fold. The overweight and obesity epidemic in childhood and adolescence will be a major determinant of the future health of large segments of the world's vulnerable populations. These trends are associated with the increase of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) that are among the leading causes of death in almost every country of the LAC region. This project aims to establish and sustain a community of practice for the improvement of food systems for NCD prevention in Latin America. It will promote collaborative learning among individuals and organizations involved with the development and use of evidence for improving sustainable, healthy diets across populations. It will reinforce international cooperation, strengthen research and advocacy tools, and establish inter-country and multi-actor knowledge hubs to address common food systems challenges in the region. A strong emphasis on embedding gender analysis will strengthen the quality of research and related policy implications. A regional strategy to significantly improve standards on front-of-package labeling will be developed as a pilot of collaboration, preceding other priority knowledge syntheses and policy objectives. Institutions leading sub-regional hubs will coordinate priority knowledge and action lines and put emphasis in collaborating with countries with weaker experience in order to strengthen multi-actor research and advocacy capacities and policy awareness. Five institutions, mostly led by women researchers, will launch the regional community of practice: the Brazilian Institute for Consumers Defense, the Inter-American Heart Foundation, the Institute of Nutrition and Food Technology (Chile), the Institute for Clinical Effectiveness and Health Policy (Argentina) and the National Institute of Public Health (Mexico). Each have individual strengths and strong records of achievement with generating evidence, raising public awareness, and influencing policies for healthier food systems.

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

The project involved five regional food systems players with recognized senior experience and strong linkages in the region: the Brazilian Institute for Consumers Defense (IDEC), who played the convening role in bringing together all parties, the Institute for Clinical and Sanitary Effectiveness of Argentina (IECS), the National Institute of Technology and Nutrition of Chile (INTA), and two regional organizations, the Interamerican Health Foundation (IAHF) and the Coalition for Healthy Latin America (CLAS). The Mexican National Institute of Public Health (INSP) was involved as subrecipient of INTA, and FIC Argentina (FIC) as subrecipient of CLAS.

Together they achieved relevant good outcomes in the process of building a dynamic community of practice (CoP). The novel CoP included research, advocacy and policy goals with the purpose of promoting healthier, inclusive, sustainable and climate friendly food systems.

a) The multi-institutional team developed sound conceptual and governance frameworks that were shared and agreed with a broad constituency of players (Conceptual and Political Framework and Governance documents, in the Outputs Section). After a series of consultations, the CoP adopted the COLANSA acronym (Comunidad de Practica Latino America y Caribe Nutricion y Salud). COLANSA's membership requests are validated by the Steering Committee, composed by the 5 core institutions. Memberships include both individual and institutional members. As of July 2022, COLANSA had 190 members including 166 individuals and 24 organizations from 18 countries, as a reflect of the strong interest raised by the CoP and its capacity to reach a relevant audience.

COLANSA is composed by strong academic institutions as INTA (Chile) and IECS (Argentina) as well as highly recognized advocacy players as IDEC and CLAS. IDEC has the capacity to conduct sound research projects as well as to act an advocacy player and inform policies in Brazil. CLAS has a focus on advocacy and policy influence and has engaged multiple actors in the region.

COLANSA members institutional legitimacy in this field, its very active communications strategy and its multi-actor composition were key to achieve a leadership role and ensure its sustainability as a regional player. COLANSA developed strong strategic plans and adopted a legal entity status.

b) COLANSA developed a Gender Conceptual Framework that was broadly discussed among members. COLANSA also developed, validated and adopted a novel tool to Assess Gender in Food Systems Projects (see the Outputs Section). This was a previous gap in the field of healthy food systems in the LAC region. It was made possible given the commitment of the Steering Committee team, composed by five strong women, and the active role played by members from multiple countries of the region.

c) INTA (Chile), seconded by IAHF, was in charge of the development of the Front of Package Food Labelling (FoPFL) Regional Hub. The Hub made relevant contributions by systematizing and sharing existent evidence on FoPFL policies (see the links in the Outputs section).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC CRDI

In the past decade, Chile played a leadership role in the implementation of FoP food warning labels in the region. It was the first country to approve a FoP warning food system label. INTA made significant contributions to the Chilean policy and conducted sound evaluations of its impact. Considering the Chilean experience and with support of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/WHO), the policy was followed by several countries in the region.

The design of the project included in its strategic approach the establishment of Regional Hubs on key food policy topics. Given the important work made by members institutions and the policy momentum, COLANSA decided to establish the first Regional Hub of the community of practice on the topic of FoP food labelling. The hub was led by INTA. COLANSA's Regional Hub successfully compiled, analyzed and shared a relevant set of evidence available in the region on the design, implementation and evaluation of FoP food labels.

d) The project contributed to develop regional capacities through multiple webinars and the development of training courses on policy incidence approaches and communication tools. Two videos on policy evidence and communication were followed by a series of training activities reaching a cohort of more than 30 young researchers in its first edition. They will be replicated by COLANSA and adapted to different audiences. See the LAC Leadership Nutrition Program (LILANUT) activities in IDEC outputs and the training course included in CLAS outputs. LILANUT is a training program of the LAC Society of Nutrition where COLANSA plays a prominent role.

e) Communication strategies were directed to raise public awareness, reach relevant multi-actor constituencies and influence policies and were based on existent scientific evidence on healthy food systems and public health nutrition. Communication tools used the evidence compiled by the FoP food labelling regional hub, the analysis of regional food policies made by IAHF and a series of materials prepared by IDEC and CLAS. An additional important contribution was the web-based library of documents done by IAHF.

An important set of communication tools were implemented by the project, taking advantage of IDEC and CLAS strong communication capacities, including social media tools, the COLANSA bulletin, the policy brief on FoP food labelling, videos, and webinars (see IDEC annexes 16 to 33 and CLAS annexes included in the Outputs Section).

Also, IDEC was in charge of developing and maintaining COLANSA website https://colansa.org/en/

2. If appropriate, explain why outputs were not completed or were of poor quality.
Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

Research outputs are appropriate and respond to the nature of this project to build a novel community of practice linking key researchers and actors in the field of healthy food systems.

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

## 4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

The focus of the project was to make a significant contribution to the field of public health nutrition in the LAC region. COLANSA has positioned itself as a relevant regional player convening key constituencies supporting healthy and sustainable food systems.

During multiple years IDRC supported in LAC a set of projects on regulatory policies for healthier food systems (marketing, labelling, taxing ...). IDRC research partners contributed with quality evidence in support of a new wave of food system policies. Currently LAC is having a regional leadership in this domain. A few years ago, IDRC research partners raised the need to build a new mechanism enabling a more collaborative work in the region. The momentum was very appropriate to go beyond supporting individual projects, respond to their demand and support the development of stronger horizontal links between the different teams in the region. As a result of this process, COLANSA is now a dynamic novel regional player, involving researchers, advocates, civil society players and decision makers. At the same time, an increasing awareness on the environmental and climate implication of the food system has emerged in the region.

Though the main thematic focus of COLANSA team members is on the public health outcomes of the food system, they have gradually integrated the healthy food systems approach into a broader perspective linking health, environmental and climate friendly food systems.

## 5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC CRDI

The actual results of the project are well aligned with IDRC original expectations. COLANSA has achieved an important growth, has strong links with key players as PAHO and appropriate channels to reach public health authorities in most countries of the region. COLANSA is currently funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies.

IDRC efforts to work on healthy, resilient, equitable, sustainable and climate friendly food systems should consider taking advantage of the current opportunities in LAC to make a difference in this field.

## 6. How did this project contribute one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the Strategic Plan. Provide specific numbers where possible.

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy. Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

- Invest in knowledge and innovation for large-scale positive change
- Build the leaders for today and tomorrow
- Be the partner of choice for greater impact

The project contributes to a large-scale positive change by strengthening the constituency of multi-actor players working in this field and playing an active role in influencing regional policies. The inter-country collaboration is expected to expand the scale of work and amplify the awareness of strategic stakeholders and key audiences on the need to build healthier and more sustainable food systems.

The project contributed to build leadership by strengthening the capacities of teams with lower expertise and by collaborating in countries where research and policies are less advanced. COLANSA members at the LAC Society of Nutrition play a key role in the implementation of training courses with a focus on young researchers.

COLANSA has strong linkages with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/WHO). Bloomberg Philanthropies is currently supporting COLANSA to strengthen its role as a relevant research to policy player in LAC.

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

The Inter-American Health Foundation (IAHF) component experienced important administrative and financial issues and delays in the submission of technical and financial reports. In part, this is due to the fact that IAHF LAC main historical leader, with vast experience and in charge of the CLAS network, left the institution and her replacement, though with a relevant academic background, was much less experienced. The transition was also challenged due to interpersonal differences. While the former leader kept an active role as coordinator of the CLAS network and achieved a sound work, the role of IAHF in the project experienced strong challenges. IAHF had serious difficulties in submitting appropriate financial reports and this determined important delays and an underrun of IAHF funds. With the agreement and support of all COLANSA parties, the positive balance of COLANSA funds were used to support the CLAS network as a 5th component of the project. CLAS promptly successfully completed its formalities to acquire a legal independent status. By the end of the project, IAHF could contribute with appropriate outputs and provided satisfactory final reports, while CLAS reinforced its role as dynamic regional player.

# STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC CRDI

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

The initial emphasis on a collaborative modus operandi was very important to ensure the success of the project. The Steering Committee met monthly under the leadership of IDEC and ensured the progress of the project and coordination between all parties. It also contributed to appropriately address the challenges posed by the pandemic.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

The project did not imply any major ethical risks. The Steering Committee is composed by and experienced team of professionals and researchers. The analysis and compilation of evidence was based on secondary data. The membership to COLANSA implied to adhere to its conceptual and political framework and sign a declaration of non conflicts of interest.

## Program Leader / Manager comments

Program Leaders/Managers should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

COLANSA and several of its members are looked to by organisations globally for their leadership, experience and successes in research, evaluation and advocacy for food environment policies. Some of their work is being replicated or adapted in Africa and Asia. Several members also led the recently closed project on an Agenda for Action – Transitioning to a Healthy Sustainable Food System in LAC (109603). COLANSA has developed largely has a result of IDRC-funded work in LAC since 2011 and has attracted/leveraged substantial funding also from Bloomberg Philanthropies, which has recently awarded COLANSA further support for leadership within the region.

COLANSA and members will be consulted on our future CRFS work in Latin America to strengthen collaboration with organisations working more closely at community level, or with indigenous peoples on alternative food production systems and motivating change in their food environments.

Greg Hallen
CRFS Team Leader.

## Director comments

The relevant Program or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

The project engaged with local communities and stakeholders while developing regional capacities through multiple webinars and the development of training courses on policy incidence approaches and communication tools. Additionally, communication strategies were directed to raise public awareness, reach relevant multi-actor constituencies, and influence policies based on existent scientific evidence on healthy food systems and public health nutrition. As presented by the PO in the PCR, it was crucial for the success of this project to reinforce international cooperation, strengthen research and advocacy tools, and establish inter-country and multi-actor knowledge hubs to address common food systems challenges in the region.

The project made significant efforts to embed gender analysis and promote women's empowerment as part of the regional research and advocacy agenda of the community of practice. The project developed a Gender Conceptual Framework that was broadly discussed
