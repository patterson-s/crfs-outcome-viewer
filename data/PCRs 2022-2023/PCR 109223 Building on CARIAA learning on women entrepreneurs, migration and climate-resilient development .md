# Project Highlights

What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

Contributions to the agenda and position for UK Presidency of COP26 in 2021:

The project made direct contributions on the climate change and migration nexus to the following UK parliamentary committees ahead of COP26: House of Lords EU Home Affairs Sub-Committee on the impacts of climate change on population movement (oral evidence) and House of Commons International Development Committee Inquiry: Climate change, Development and COP26 (written evidence).

Briefings and consultations were also conducted by the project team for the Glasgow Imperative: closing the Adaptation Gap and Responding to Climate Impacts for the UK COP26 Presidency

Direct support to the Government of Bangladesh in finalising the Action Plan for Internal Displacement.

The project synthesised CARIAA lessons and outcomes to stimulate the National Strategy for Internal Displacement in Bangladesh. Professor Siddiqui (a project member) was appointed to develop an Action Plan based on the National Strategy. To support consultations with representatives from different ministries, the team conducted focus groups in six hotspots identified in the country's Delta Plan 2100. The synthesis work provides insights into dimensions of migration that help inform the National Action Plan.

The project team helped to appoint and implement the International Advisory Group on Action Plan for Implementation of the National Strategy on Internal Displacement, that includes development funders, key knowledge brokers and international scientists.

The project team also participated in the international launch of the Action plan at the COP26 event at the Bangladesh Pavilion in Glasgow, led by Professor Siddiqui, and including both the Minister for Disaster Management and the Relief and the Minister for Environment and Climate Change. This brought attention to the issue of internal displacement as a key element of Non-Economic Loss and Damage in the UNFCCC negotiation process.

Informing Kenya's National Drought Management Authority to improve small business opportunities for women in Laikipia Country, Kenya

The National Drought Management Authority is mandated to deal with drought emergencies in Kenya and coordinate all the activities related to drought risk management

Findings generated from this project are expected to bring positive change to vulnerable communities in Laikipia County, specifically women entrepreneurs who are constantly challenged with access to resources such as finances, markets, infrastructure, technology, and social services such as water and electricity.

Northern parts of Laikipia are predominantly arid and dry lands (ASAL). The majority of the inhabitants depend on livestock as well as small businesses for their livelihoods. There are efforts to support women traders financially, for instance, through the Enterprise Fund of the County government of Laikipia. However, the fund is limited to well established women groups which means many women traders remain left out of such programmes.

The project worked with NDMA and the Laikipia County to highlight the key challenges that women entrepreneurs in the Arid and semi-arid lands face and the impacts of these challenges on women's business operations. Recommendations from the project are expected to be taken up, specifically: the use of Village Saving and Loan Associations to facilitate local fundraising is proposed by the project team. The expected outcome will be that more women will have access to sustainable financial resources which will help in building resilient businesses and improved livelihoods and well-being.

Conceptual advance: Gannon et al (2022), The triple vulnerability of female entrepreneurs to climate risk in sub-Saharan Africa: Gendered barriers and enablers to private sector adaptation. Commissioned by WIRES Climate Change. https://doi.org/10.1002/wcc.793

Abstract: The ability of businesses to adapt effectively to climate change is highly influenced by the external business enabling environment. Constraints to adaptive capacity are experienced by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) across sub-Saharan Africa, regardless of the gender of the business owner. However, gender is a critical social cleavage through which differences in adaptive capacity manifest and in Africa most entrepreneurs are women. We conduct a systematic review to synthesize existing knowledge on differential vulnerability of female entrepreneurs in Africa to climate risk, in relation to their sensitivity to extreme climate events and their adaptive capacity. We synthesize this literature using a vulnerability analysis approach that situates vulnerability and adaptive capacity within the context of the wider climate risk framework denoted in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report. In doing so, we identify gendered barriers and enablers to private sector adaptation and suggest women entrepreneurs face a "triple differential vulnerability" to climate change, wherein they: (1) are often more sensitive to climate risk, as a result of their concentration in certain sectors and types of enterprises (e.g., micro SMEs in the agricultural sector in remote regions); (2) face additional barriers to adaptation in the business environment, including access to finance, technologies, (climate and adaptation) information and supportive policies; and (3) are also often concurrently on the frontline of managing climate risk at household levels. Since various forms of inequality often create compounding experiences of discrimination and vulnerability, we pay particular attention to how factors of differential vulnerability intersect, amplify, and reproduce.

Highlights: 1) Migrants do not frequently identify environmental risks as primary driver for movement; 2) Perceived risk of drought and insecurity reduce stated future migration intentions; 3) Perceptions of environmental risks alter aggregate migration flows in coastal regions.

Abstract: Environmental change influences population movements at various temporal and spatial scales. Yet individual decisions to migrate involve multiple motivations including perceived environmental risks and economic opportunities. We analyze how perceptions of environmental risks affect migration decisions and future migration intentions. We use cross-sectional household survey data (N = 5,450) from populations engaged in migration in net out-migration areas in four coastal areas in Ghana, Bangladesh, and India to examine ex post-migration motivations and ex ante-future migration intentions. The data include variables on previous migration, migration intentions, well-being, food insecurity, and perceived long-term environmental degradation. The results show that few households identified environmental risks as the primary driver for past migration decisions. Perceived

increased severity of drought and household insecurity both reduce stated future migration intentions. Hence, perceptions of environmental risks, including future potential changes, are significant in altering aggregate migration flows from source areas in low-lying coastal regions.

# Project Outcomes

How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

This project has resulted in important synthesis in three key thematic areas important to the climate change adaptation research agenda writ large, and to the CLARE program going forward. First, the project has led to advances in understanding of the role of gender in adaptation efforts among female entrepreneurs in sub-Saharan Africa, specially elaborating a framework of the 'triple vulnerability' of women. Second, the project has resulted in advances in climate mobilities research related to the risks migrants face in source and destination areas, the well-being of migrants in urban areas, and by elaborating a research agenda for mobilities research that bring these threads together. Third, the project has resulted in the elaboration of the climate resilient development pathways concept, and resulted in this concept being included in the latest IPCC Assessment report.

How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

Covid-19 related travel restrictions delivered a blow to all three components of this project. All three teams were required to pivot and change their methodologies. The team most negatively impacted was -003, where a post doc was unable to join the team as planned, seriously undermining progress on desk top review. In-country stakeholder engagement in Kenya was also undermined by travel restriction in this project, resulting in a request for a second extension. -001 was forced to adjust their in-country engagement, limiting this to virtual means, which has undermined the extent of policy engagement and impact achieved in that component. -002 was conceived as a desk top study from inception, and so was less negatively impacted. This team also held a full project meeting in Ghana just before Covid restrictions were imposed in 2020, so this team was able to get off to a good start, even though future face-to-face meetings were cancelled. Overall, this cohort of projects promised synthesis of CARIAA findings and engagement in science-policy fora: it was able to deliver strongly on synthesis, and less than expected on science-policy engagement, due largely to factors outside of the research teams' control (i.e. Covid).

## Financial performance

Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

## Strategic Considerations

Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

## Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

Georgina eloquently captures a key strength and key lesson of this project:

A key strength lies in the quality of the outputs generated. Beyond the academic quality of being published through scientific journals, the outputs represent valuable synthesis of previously funded

research. Each team brought together insights and evidence from a body of work in a manner that is more convincing and more enriching than IDRC could have done on its own. This speaks to the potential for working with previously funded team towards achieving the Strategy 2030 goals of knowledge sharing.

A key lesson lies in the "importance of strong, equal, partnerships with southern-based researchers". Georgina highlights the imperative for IDRC to intentionally provide opportunity for southern leadership. The pandemic context underscored the resilience offered by having in-country partners and activities that are less reliant on international travel. In reflecting on the CLARE transitional grants, the team identified ways to encourage southern and local leadership in the CLARE2 call launched in 2022.

Further aspects of learning from this project concern sustaining relationships and nurturing cohorts:

Underpinning the CLARE transition was an implicit aim to sustain some of the relationship among researchers and with stakeholders that had been forged during the previous partnership, while IDRC and FCDO established the next generation of funding opportunities. This aspect was successful in my opinion, as people and ideas involved contribute to the highly scored proposals for CLARE2.

The CLARE transition was less successful in sustaining collaboration across diverse and distinct activities. As Georgina states, merely collecting grants into a single IDRC project is insufficient to create cohort. More intention and investment are required to create synergy and ensure a cohort becomes more than the "sum of its parts".

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

As presented in this PCR, the outputs represent a valuable synthesis of previously funded research beyond the academic quality of being published through scientific journals. As shown by the PO and PL comments, this project and its results highlight the imperative for IDRC to provide an opportunity for southern leadership intentionally.

As part of the CLARE1, this project has been crucial to the CRFS vision for climate adaptation and resilience, new programming of CRF, that has recently materialized on the launch of CLARE (2).

I approve this PCR
