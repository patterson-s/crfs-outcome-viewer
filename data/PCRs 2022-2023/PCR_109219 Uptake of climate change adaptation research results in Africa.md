# Project Highlights

What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

In Namibia, the project built on work initiated under ASSAR (107640) to increase agency, advance knowledge and collaboration for climate action through active and strategic engagement with key actors from national, regional and local levels:

56 Parliamentarians from the standing committees on Natural Resources and Economic and Public Administration now have an increased understanding of the implications of climate change on Namibia and climate action strategies as a result of participating in an interactive short-course on climate change developed and delivered by the project team. The course included presentations by experts from within and beyond Namibia, and field visits to various institutions/companies to learn how they are incorporating new emerging climate-smart technologies, and innovative ways to adapt to climate change. The team will develop this as a short course under the University of Namibia's short course bureau.

Members of the Constituency Development Committees from Onesi, Okahao and Otanmanzi constituencies learned about climate change, adaptation strategies, how to establish community self-help groups, and options for generating income with locally available resources by participating in three training workshops co-facilitated with the Namibia Institute for Democracy.

Youth were engaged through the Omusati Schools Climate Action Competition. The regional educational directorate gained an in-depth understanding for climate change and the region has proposed to have climate change included in the school curriculum.

Principal Investigator, Bernadette Shalumbu (DRFN), and Margaret Angula (University of Namibia) attended COP26 in Glasgow as part of the Namibian delegation and were panelists in Government of Namibia side-events.

In Senegal, the project trialed a participatory planning process that integrated climate change into the local development planning process and worked to better align the Plans de Développement Communaux with Senegal's vision 2035 articulated in the Plan Sénégal Emergent:

Project guided by key stakeholders, convened through two structures, including 1) the National platform of stakeholders set up to guide project directions and foster learning and collaboration across local, regional and national level actors for policy uptake and 2) a technical committee to implement the pilots within selected municipalities.

Based on lessons from an evaluation conducted of pilots initiated under PRISE (107643) in two municipalities (Ndiob and Dianké Souf), the technical committee worked with stakeholders in 4 municipalities to pilot the participatory planning process, develop local development plans and draw out learning from the process.

A planning guide was developed to integrate the climate change dimension in Senegal as well as the integration of climate change sensitive tools. This was achieved in partnership with the Union of Associations of Local Elected Officials (UAEL), the National Program for Local Development (PNDL) and the Ministry of Decentralization, Territorial Communities and Land Management (MDCTAT).

The new approach to local development planning was adopted by the Ministry of Decentralization, Local Government and Land Management (MDCTAT). A partnership resulted with UN Capital Development Fund to implement the planning process in 3 other municipalities.

In Mali, the team built on a pilot initiated under ASSAR (107640), to increase resilience and adaptive capacities of those making use of water collected in a water catchment bassin (Bassin de Collecte des Eaux de Ruissellement - BCER) in Koutiala:

Collaboration for collective BCER resource sharing and management increased among local stakeholders (approx. 35, 51% women) including community members, local officials and civil society organizations (e.g. ongoing dialogue on barriers and enablers to sharing BCER water and land resources; idea exchange among community members of potential income generating activities linked to BCER)

Improved the water retention of the N'Goutjina BCER with a concrete basin liner and supplemented the BCER with a solar pump and water tower at the adjacent borehole for a more reliable source of water for irrigating crops, a resource for future aquaculture, and alternative income generating activities through market vegetable gardens around the perimeter of the BCER.

N'Goutjina BCER users' capacities increased through trainings on climate smart vegetable production, aquaculture and solar pump equipment maintenance

Young Francophone scientists gained participatory research and leadership competencies for collaborating and navigating complexity through participation in the 4-module Sustainability Leadership Course developed by START and REOS partners and delivered through online platform Notion.

If appropriate, explain why outputs were not completed or were of poor quality.

Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

The work in Namibia, Senegal and Mali had a strong emphasis on participatory action research and the bulk of activities were engagement sessions, workshops and trainings with stakeholders. Outputs produced reflect this orientation and were developed for users and/or as part of project communications efforts. The quality of the communications outputs is variable and arguably of varying utility depending on how it has been disseminated through relevant channels.

The Namibia team reported that two journal articles are still under development since they ran out of time to prioritise reflection and writing for peer reviewed publication.

## Project Outcomes

How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

This project is part of CLARE1 transitional grants which was intended to afford strong, well-performing teams an opportunity to pursue further scaling and uptake. These grants were envisioned to require only 'light touch' monitoring while IDRC and DFID were largely dedicated to scoping and design of the subsequent CLARE2 partnership.

Despite this intention, all three teams had to significantly adapt their workplans soon after the project start in April 2020 due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and also over time as the situation evolved. This was particularly challenging as all projects were heavily based on direct and on-going engagement with stakeholders. All teams required additional time to achieve objectives. Moreover, this

required more frequent interaction by the responsible PO with teams to help them navigate the dynamic and changing pandemic situation.

In Namibia and Mali, those members of the project teams based outside the country never travelled and ended up collaborating purely through use of virtual communication and collaboration tools (e.g. mural and session lab). Strong existing partnerships and commitment proved essential. As a result of the situation, in-country leadership became essential and was afforded additional resources and prominence than originally intended (e.g. to enable the NGO AMEDD in Koutiala, Mali to lead community-level activities; to empower the Namibian team to facilitate training of parliamentarians).

All teams noted the learning, adaptation and innovation that occurred as a result of the pandemic – to learn new collaborative tools as teams, to equip stakeholders' effective participation (e.g. training on zoom application), to develop virtual or hybrid alternatives to in-person trainings/workshops/consultations, etc.. Some challenges could be overcome but others proved more difficult (poor network coverage and lack of facilities in remote areas to support virtual/hybrid meetings). This was a challenging but insightful experience for researchers from START International and Reos Partners in particular, and lessons learned will be taken forward in future collaborative projects to support Southern-led research and reduce the carbon-footprint of travel-intensive activities.

How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.

Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy.

Provide specific numbers where possible.

As part of the CLARE1 partnership, this project contributed to the third corporate objective from the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan of mobilizing alliances for impact. At the time of writing this report, IDRC had recently signed a renewed partnership agreement for the next five years of collaboration with FCDO on Climate Adaptation and Resilience (CLARE). That agreement was made possible both through the results of the CLARE1 cohort, and the intentionally 'light touch' monitoring that enabled IDRC staff to dedicate themselves more fully to partnership development.

The project provides examples of enhancing multi-level government collaboration (Namibia and Senegal) and further insights into the complex dynamics related to shared resource use (Mali) as we pursue our programming on climate-resilient food systems.

## Financial performance

Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

As part of the CLARE1 cohort, this project provided both narrative technical reports and submissions to an online monitoring centre that aggregated data on research outputs, engagement events, capacity building, and examples of demand, endorsement and change. The template for technical reports was tailored to CLARE1 needs, focusing less on project activities and more on identifying how results aligned with program aims.

This project presents lessons on a) adaptive and flexible grant management, b) requiring grantees to prepare and implement safeguarding protocols, and integration of gender equality and inclusion (GEI).

Adaptive, flexible and attentive grant management

Our approach to managing these projects was very much influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic and dictated by the MOU we had with FCDO. All teams were eventually granted no-cost extensions into 2022 once the MOU with FCDO was extended. The project durations went from the original duration (14 – 16 months), to 19 months in Senegal and 21 months for the teams working in Namibia and Mali. All teams appreciated IDRC's understanding and flexibility, for example to repurpose funds intended for international travel to cover extra personnel time.

Extra attention for the Namibia team on managing this first IDRC research grant supported the strong and well-organized PI, Bernadette Shalumbu. The frequent reporting requirements (given high risk rating) ensured frequent check-ins with the PO and GAD Office, and while extra work, likely proved a useful learning experience for the PI and her team.

Safeguarding protocols

Due to the partnership with FCDO, grantees were required to submit safeguarding protocols at the six-month mark. The process of developing the safeguarding protocol proved a valuable learning opportunity for grantees. PI Mary Thompson-Hall noted learning on how to transfer information from

--- Page 5 ---

START's internal safeguarding procedures into its programmatic work and learning from collaborating partners' approaches. For IPR/IFP and IED-Afrique this was a new learning experience and will serve as a model for future projects. For IED-Afrique it has led to revisions to the institution's procedures manual with the board of directors to take into consideration the rights and protection of collaborating partners.

Supporting grantees through the process was also a valuable learning experience for the PO. In particular, it worked well not to have a required template or format, but rather to encourage grantees to develop a protocol that drew on their institutional policies and would be fit for purpose for the particular project. CLARE now has a variety of examples and experiences to draw on should IDRC move forward to institutionalize this requirement.

## GEI integration

Two of three projects struggled to speak about the GEI dimensions of their work, even when their activities did actually address differential vulnerability in a thoughtful way. Their reporting mainly focused on numbers of women participating in project activities, gender balance within the team. This speaks to the importance of a continued dialogue on GEI with teams to help them articulate this dimension of their work.

This project also prompts questions about our business process and how best to consider related investments within project monitoring and reporting to realise synergies and efficiencies:

IDRC has more than one active grant with IED-Afrique but they are each managed separately.

The work in Namibia benefited directly from a CDKN-funded project – Strengthening regional climate change governance through integrating gender-responsive climate action in Namibia (July 2019 – June 2021) that overlapped with the period of CLARE funding. The canvas on What does 1.5C mean for Namibia and the animated film Namibia is heating up: What global warming of $2^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ means for this climate change hotspot were high-quality resources developed with the CDKN support and used during the training for parliamentarians. Given the synergies between these two activities but separate reporting mechanisms, it took some work to clarify the key value-add from this investment. In this case, CDKN worked in a hands on way with the team and several articles including Lessons from mainstreaming climate change in Namibia are featured on the CDKN website.

The project in Mali is very relevant to other prior IDRC-funded projects on catchment basins (BCERs) (108755; 106549). Given the responsible POs knowledge of these partners and their work, linkages were made and the PO could relay relevant lessons to inform the team's approach.

Finally, the financial performance of component 002 is to be noted. Despite the no-cost extension granted, the component was underspent by $29\%$ at project completion. It is noted that IED-Afrique was only required to submit a financial report at closure based on their low risk rating. The PO had no notice from the team about underspending prior to receipt of the final financial report, otherwise additional time could have been granted.

## Strategic Considerations

Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

--- Page 6 ---

A number of concurrent and unforeseen challenges had to be managed for component 003 in Mali, including the global pandemic with strict limitations on travel and gatherings, a government coup with associated curfews and restrictions on movement, and heightened security threat levels due to criminal and terrorist threats.

Given existing security threats in Mali, and to mitigate the risks and potential harm to team members and participants in the project, START was required to develop a detailed security plan with their local and international partners from the outset of the project. According to the PI, that plan proved quite valuable to the team throughout the project, especially given the dynamic and challenging security context. It helped to establish very clear lines of communication for the team including the student researchers conducting fieldwork and protocols for keeping the team up to date on any security issues, any restrictions on movements, curfews, etc. via the collaborating NGO AMEDD and researcher Dr. Amadou Sidibe based in Bamako.

Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

The COVID-19 context required new considerations for how research activities could be conducted in a manner that would not compromise human health. Partners were diligent and consistent in adhering to public health guidance and policies for the countries and areas in which they worked.

As noted in response to question 8, these projects also developed safeguarding protocols, appreciated as a learning opportunity and compliment to more standard consideration of ethics in research projects.

## Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

This project contributes to program-level learning, ranging from how to sustain international collaboration without travel, to the benefits of a curiosity-driven approach to safeguarding (starting with where teams are rather than imposing templates). A hybrid gathering of CRFS team members in early 2022 also reflected on the multiple ways of expressing southern leadership. This delved into examining 'who does what' and not merely the organization that receives funds. This project is notable for going beyond CARIAA, to directly fund Desert Research Foundation of Namibia where previous work was funded through the University of Cape Town. This program-level learning and experience will benefit CLARE2 projects.
