# Project Highlights

What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

The project generated knowledge and empirical evidence which supported the promotion of Quinoa as a strategic crop that can improve resilience and livelihoods of communities living in marginal ecosystems in Morocco. The project developed, tested, and scaled up innovations to address the challenges of production, processing, and marketing of the nascent Quinoa value chain. It built capacity and enhanced an enabling policy environment to promote Quinoa. The key results are summarized as follows:

Official registration in the national germplasm catalog of five Quinoa varieties with high tolerance to abiotic stresses, high productivity, and yield stability. The five varieties were introduced by the International Center for Biosaline Agriculture and evaluated through trials for two years in the experimental station of Mohammed VI Polytechnic University and under real farm conditions as well. On average, improved varieties increased Quinoa yield by 38% (under rainfed agriculture) and by 121% (under irrigation) in comparison to local varieties.

Key engagement of the private sector in the upgrading of Quinoa value chain at the production and processing levels through:

The establishment of a seed production system to ensure sustainability of the reproduction of the improved varieties introduced by the project and registered in the national germplasm catalog.

The manufacturing of a pearling machine to remove the saponin of Quinoa grains, a substance responsible of the bitter taste of Quinoa which negatively affects its marketability. In addition to the pearling machine, the project pioneered the introduction of three other machines in Morocco (a thresher, a winnower, and a washer) and facilitated their local manufacturing by the private sector. It was found that the use of machinery in Quinoa production and processing reduces the production cost by 28% under rainfed conditions.

Creation of four new cooperatives (three are women-led) for Quinoa production and/or processing and upgrading of two existing ones (one is women-led). Upgrading interventions at the production, processing and marketing levels were piloted with these cooperatives. In addition to the introduction of improved varieties and of machineries, interventions included:

The creation of the first group of organic Quinoa producers in the country with a certification of organic production granted in 2019. This would open opportunities for export to Europe and to the Gulf countries.

Diversification of Quinoa-based products to enhance marketability.

Facilitating the process of obtaining a sanitary authorization in one of the women-led cooperatives. This enabled the marketing of Quinoa-based products of this cooperative in one of the main supermarket supply chain in Morocco.

The project enhanced women economic empowerment through upgrading Quinoa processing (mechanical removal of saponin to improve quality and diversification of Quinoa-based products to enhance marketability) and through linking women-led cooperatives to niche markets. The pearling

machine reduced substantially women drudgery. The quantity that the machine can process in one hour requires 20 hours to be processed manually by one woman.

The project improved the income of smallholder farmers who are producing and marketing Quinoa. Under rainfed conditions, it was found that the net profit of one hectare cultivated with Quinoa is more than triple and around 7 times the net profit of one hectare cultivated with wheat and barley, respectively.

The project enhanced the resilience of smallholder farmers under rainfed conditions against erratic rainfall and drought given the high tolerance of Quinoa improved varieties introduced by the project to abiotic stresses, in comparison to wheat and barley.

Building the capacity of around 550 persons (including farmers, engineers, technicians and extension agents from different public agricultural departments) in different aspects related to Quinoa production, processing and marketing. This capacity building and the support of the project to six cooperatives contributed to an increase in the area cultivated with Quinoa under these cooperatives from 75 ha at the beginning of the project to 481 ha at its end, with an increase in the number of Quinoa producers from 105 to 656 farmers. It is worth mentioning that the chairing of the project's steering committee by the Governor of the province facilitated its implementation and enhanced its outreach. An important result of the capacity building is the use of materials and guidelines developed by the project in the ongoing training programs by the National Office for Agricultural Advisory Services targeting farmers on best cropping practices.

Scaling up Quinoa value chain through contribution to the development of projects funded by public actors:

This project contributed to the development of four projects funded by influential public actors, and aiming at strengthening Quinoa value chain in the target province of the project (Rhamna) as well as in Northern and Southern Morocco. The main innovations introduced by the project (Quinoa improved varieties and machineries) are/will be adopted by the four projects, having together a total budget of around 2 million CAD and targeting around 1200 farmers.

## Project Outcomes

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

The project upgraded the nascent Quinoa value chain in Morocco by developing and testing innovations at the production, processing, and marketing levels. It increased the income of smallholder farmers by enhancing their participation in the Quinoa value chain and improved their resilience to erratic rainfall and drought through the introduction of new varieties with high tolerance to abiotic stresses. The project enhanced women economic empowerment through upgrading Quinoa processing (mechanical removal of saponin to improve quality and diversification of Quinoa-based products to

--- Page 3 ---

enhance marketability) and through linking women-led cooperatives to niche markets. The introduced mechanical removal of saponin reduced substantially women drudgery.

How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

The project intended to target 200 farmers in the pilot phase and 1000 farmers in the scaling up phase in the Province of Rhamna. It supported six cooperatives in the production and/or processing of Quinoa, increasing the number of Quinoa producers in these cooperatives from 105 farmers at the beginning of the project to 656 at its end. The scaling up of project's innovations went beyond the targeted province and reached communities in Northern and Southern Morocco. The Chairing of the steering committee by the Governor of Rhamna facilitated the implementation of the project in the province.

The strong visibility of the project and the collaboration with key stakeholders from the public and private sectors enhanced the scaling up of innovations to other provinces. It is estimated that the number of Quinoa producers who are using project's improved varieties is at least 1000 farmers.

The project covered well the upgrading interventions of Quinoa value chain at the production and processing levels. Several activities addressed the marketing and consumption levels including diversification of Quinoa-based products, promotion of Quinoa consumption, facilitation of organic production certification and of sanitary authorization, labeling and linkages to niche markets. The piloting of marketing linkages took place in one of the six supported cooperatives. The project could have done better in materialising the linkages to niche markets as part of the piloted business model. The planned final national dissemination workshop did not take place because of COVID-19 restrictions. A policy brief was developed for dissemination.

How did this project contribute one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

The project generated knowledge and empirical evidence which supported the promotion of Quinoa as a strategic crop that can improve resilience and livelihoods of communities living in marginal ecosystems in Morocco. Quinoa area in the Province of Rhamna under the supported cooperatives increased from 75 ha at the beginning of the project to 481 ha at its end. The number of Quinoa producers who are using project's improved varieties is expected to reach at least 2000 farmers by 2022. This is in alignment with IDRC's strategic objective in the programming cycle of 2015-2020: "Invest in knowledge and innovation for large-scale positive change".

## Financial performance

Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC’s administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

No lessons or observations to be reported.

## Strategic Considerations

Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

The Project Approval Document pointed to a low risk associated with the coordination of a large team from different institutions and disciplines, as well as with the communication between ICBA project coordinator who is based in the United Arab Emirates and the national project coordinator who is based in Morocco. This risk was effectively mitigated (as envisaged) by the extensive experience of the national coordinator in managing field-based projects and by his well-established connections with the different stakeholders in Morocco and with ICBA. The chairing of the steering committee by the Governor of the targeted province facilitated the implementation of the project.

There was a medium risk associated with farmers’ willingness and ability to adopt Quinoa cultivation as well as with the capacity of extension and advisory services to transfer the knowledge to farmers. This risk was effectively mitigated by the strong training component of the project which benefited around 550 persons (including farmers, engineers, technicians, and extension agents from different public agricultural departments) in different aspects related to Quinoa production, processing, and marketing. There was also a risk associated with extreme weather events such as heat waves and low temperature. This risk did not materialize during project’s implementation. The risk of a health pandemic was not anticipated. The restrictions associated with COVID-19 affected the distribution of locally manufactured machines. Due to lockdown, the planned training sessions for farmers and technicians were suspended. A no cost extension of 5 months was necessary, and it was granted to the project in order to successfully achieve its objectives.

Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project?

No lessons to be reported.

## Program Leader / Manager comments

Program Leaders/Managers should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

## Director comments

The relevant Program or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

The Program Officer responsible for the project Scaling up Quinoa Value Chain presents a detailed PCR. The role of Quinoa as a resilient to water stress and highly nutritional food are well known. Nevertheless, the grantees were able to generate the evidence-based information more localized. The innovations tested and more specific geographies are critical for engagement of the private sector and

--- Page 5 ---

strengthening value chains. This project is an example of the collaboration of small entrepreneurs, including the opportunity for women's economic empowerment.

The PCR highlights as a significant result the fact that the quality of the products and the integration of organic Quinoa could open market opportunities to export to Europe and the Gulf. This is one potential negative impact on producing high-quality, nutritious foods in food-insecure communities. It has been documented (i.e. Impacts of the production and export of Quinoa in Bolivia); for instance, in Latin America, the demand for the export of quality food has undermined the access to this food from indigenous and vulnerable communities. A transformation of Food Systems should look at the positive nutritional impact on the communities that produce before exporting products. A new generation of Food Security and Women's economic empowerment programs cannot neglect the need to provide access to nutritious, sustainable, and resilient food. Quinoa is the best example of this paradigm. IDRC could have considered a do-not-harm approach to better understand successful value chains' ethical and potential negative impacts.

Congratulations to the PO for the support provided to the grantees and the analysis presented in this PCR.
