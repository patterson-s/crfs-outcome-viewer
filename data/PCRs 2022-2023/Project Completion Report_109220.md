# Project Abstract

While designing a next phase of the Climate and Resilience (CLARE) partnership, IDRC and the UK Government selected a set of opportunities to further develop and scale results from predecessor programs. This project funded three opportunities in South Asia to build on the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA) for further scaling or research uptake for greater impact.

The first supported work on scaling adaptation trials to inform climate financing in Bangladesh. The research built upon earlier CARIAA results to evaluate the suitability of different options and work with government departments to invest in and scale promising adaptations and increase resilience in coastal Bangladesh.

The second sought to deepen research on health risks of rising temperatures in both urban and rural India. The team followed up on pilot studies developed under CARIAA to assess the effectiveness of India's heat stress warnings, and prepared tailored heat stress advice for rural villages working with the Indian Meteorological Department.

The third elaborated the concept of climate-resilient development pathways, based on empirical experience in the Hindu Kush Himalayan region. The team mapped the outcomes and explored the effectiveness of four livelihood innovations piloted during CARIAA to critically examine the opportunities for scaling.

The project was expected to generate peer-reviewed publications, contributions to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's sixth assessment report, policy-oriented outputs, and practice through strategic engagement and research-into-use activities. It was also expected to strengthen collaboration among researchers previously engaged in CARIAA, providing a bridge prior to the launch of new CLARE funding competitions.

# PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

In Bangladesh (001)

- Further refined "Dynamic Adaptation Model" (elaborated in project 107642) as python-based standalone desktop application using open-source software. Worked with government authorities leading national adaptation and delta investment plans. Demonstrated how the model can guide village and national planning by assessing suitability and efficiency of adaptations.
- Field survey of 1500 households across six coastal villages provide new evidence on the lived experiences of adaptation to four hazards (storm surge, salinity intrusion, flooding, and land erosion). Tested some actions proposed in the National Adaptation Plan, finding how effectiveness varies by location (e.g. rainwater harvesting more effective in central and west, groundwater wells more in the eastern delta).

On heat stress (002)

- Piloted novel rural heat advisory system, disseminating three-day forecasts via mobile text message in 20 rural villages around Jalna, Maharashtra. Information tailored to individual farmers and their livelihood activities, based on local automated weather stations installed in the villages.
- Surveyed people's experience of heat waves in Delhi: how they use and respond to advisories issued by public health and metrological departments. Found that only 10% of low-income people surveyed were aware of advisories, and only 15% of all respondents altered their behaviour in response to them. Survey also revealed strong preference (two-third of respondents) for voice messages and social media, rather than existing text messages. Another survey was organized during the COVID crisis explored how working or staying at home impacted exposure to heat stress.

On pathways (003)

- Elaborated on the theoretical concept of "Climate Resilient Development Pathways" by applying empirical experience with four adaptation technologies in the Hindu-Kush Himalaya (piloted during project 107641). In each case, new evidence and thoughtful reflection identified previously unstated factors that inhibit or catalyze scaling:

- Flood-resistant housing (Rangpur, Bangladesh) faced barriers of additional cost ($5000 per house) and shortage of carpenters who migrate in search of work.
- Climate-smart agriculture (Uttarakhand, India) uptake limited as smallholder farmers incentivized to rely on existing cultivars and limited number of crops.
- Springshed restoration (Gandaki, Nepal) as an opportunity to expand access to freshwater by Dalit communities.

3. If appropriate, explain why outputs were not completed or were of poor quality.
Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

Not applicable, yet see Q5 below.

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?
Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

In Bangladesh, the project examined the accessibility, adequacy, and equity of potential adaptation options to fine-tune the theoretical analysis and upscale those evaluated options to support the national-level adaptation demand for climate financing. Engaged with Center for Environmental and Geographical Information Services (CEGIS), informing its efforts to update national adaptation plan. Questionnaire addressed gender barriers, including constraints on women's livelihoods, mobility, and options during cyclones. Identified issues that influence scaling including people's perception and barriers to adaptation.

In India, research contributed novel insights on behavioural responses, information sources, communication channels, and perceptions on heat stress. By 2050, South Asia is at high risk for heat stress with wet bulb temperature above 28C in over 40% of summer nights. Weather stations underestimate actual conditions in low-income neighbourhoods, as indoor temperatures

![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

can be 4C warmer due to the types of houses - poorly ventilated, little insulation and without air conditioning. There is less research focused on the impact of prolonged exposure to heat versus on shorter-term acute heat waves. This project expanded knowledge on how people experience heat stress with a combination of temperature data loggers placed inside people's homes, and automatic weather stations situated in rural villages. It addressed weaknesses in existing Heat Action Plans by:

- adding coverage of rural areas (not just cities), and a focus on rural livelihood activities where people are affected by prolonged exposure to heat.
- piloting delivery of heat and health advisories in local language to over 2000 farmers in Maharashtra state by piggy-backing on an existing SMS-based agro-advisory program that WOTR has in cooperation with the Indian Meteorological Department.
- communicating specific measures individuals can take to reduce exposure/impact of heat (not just general advisory warning of heat), and
- basing advisories on context-relevant information collected from local-level weather stations (rather than those covering larger regions).

The research in the Hindu Kush Himalaya advanced the concept of "Climate resilient development pathways" to consolidate climate action and development decisions towards long term goals. Integrates adaptation and mitigation with MEL approach of "outcome mapping" to make explicit behaviour changes required to realize more desirable futures. Made explicit expectations regarding who-does-what in understanding climate risk and scaling adoption of technologies (boundary partners). Critically assessed the experience of technologies piloted under previous project, providing insights on understanding 'transformational change'(key for CLARE logframe).

5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

A key goal of this project during the CLARE1 partnership (2019-2021) was to sustain relationships that were perceived as being important, both among researchers and with stakeholders able to use research findings. This understated yet intended result was realized in all three grants. On heat stress, TERI in Delhi and WOTR in rural areas were able to continue work to engage government authorities in advancing heat action plans. On pathways, the core research team involved collaboration among six partner institutions in Bangladesh, Germany, India, Nepal, the Netherlands and Pakistan.

Yet it is in Bangladesh where the greatest gains were made. This grant saw southern leadership by the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) which continued support to the Planning Commission of Bangladesh responsible for Bangladesh Delta Plan, handover of models to Water Resources Planning Organization (WARPO), and expanded collaboration with network of local universities (including Barisal, Patuakhali, Khulna, and Bangladesh Agricultural University) along with members of different NGOs.

Public health risks and measures during the COVID pandemic disrupted all three activities. Restrictions on mobility in Bangladesh forced the team to scale back on the number of villages included in the survey. For pathways, the team was unable to convene national workshops that were initially planned as part of outreach. On heat stress, the pandemic delayed the import and installation of equipment (indoor temperature gauges with data recorder), moreover the summer of 2021 was relatively mild in terms of extreme temperatures. This team also experienced a change in leadership as well as delays in preparing submissions for peer-reviewed publication. All teams required additional time to achieve objectives. Moreover, this required more frequent interaction by the responsible PO with teams to help them navigate the dynamic and changing pandemic situation.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.

Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

As part of the CLARE1 partnership, this project contributed to the third corporate objective from the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan of mobilizing alliances for impact. Following this CLARE 1 transition period, IDRC signed a renewed partnership agreement for a next five years of collaboration with FCDO on Climate Adaptation and Resilience (CLARE). That agreement was made possible both through the results of the CLARE1 cohort, and the intentionally ‘light touch’ monitoring that enabled IDRC staff to dedicate themselves more fully to partnership development. The project furthered the generation of evidence and innovative approaches to inform adaptation planning in South Asia which we expect to build on as we pursue our programming on Climate-Resilient Food Systems and through the Global Health program (especially regarding heat impacts of climate change).

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

As identified in the PCR for project 109219, this project also presents relevant lessons on the value of a) adaptative and flexible options for grant management – essential for navigating the COVID pandemic; b) working with grantees to prepare and implement safeguarding protocols; and c) accompanying grantees for effective integration of gender equality and inclusion (GEI).

The project confirms the challenge of granting to UN organizations. Finalizing the grant agreement with United Nations University (003) was very complicated, involving back and forth negotiation on terms and conditions with legal which delayed project start up. This was further complicated by a change in lead for Pakistan that delayed that work.

While it was great to support Southern leadership in the case of BUET as the lead grantee (001), they did experience challenges to transfer funds to researchers outside of the country. With this experience in mind, it would good to explore these challenges up front and to encourage a frank discussion with BUET/ between BUET and partners for future grants to understand how any difficulties sub-granting/sub-contracting outside the country might be foreseen and ideally overcome to best facilitate collaboration.

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

Largely yes. The project was intended to scale and uptake of research results from former projects. IDRC accepted the risk that such activities might not bear fruit in terms of informing or catalyzing positive climate action. Nonetheless the results described above were remarkable especially considering the constraints imposed by the Covid pandemic, including distracted policy audiences and significant limitations to travel, stakeholder engagement and field work. The secret ingredient was the pre-existing relationships both within teams and with their intended audiences that made it possible to progress despite adverse conditions.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

No.

## Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

All three grants described above offer insights for CLARE2 and new projects selected following the 2022 competitive call. In particular:

- In Bangladesh, the results and relationships can directly feed into new efforts to improve early action protocols to reduce the impact of the surge on coastal people (project 109993).
- Heat stress remains a gap in CLARE and Global Health portfolio. Despite some promising full proposals submitted under the 2022 call, the partnership is not currently supporting work on this important topic, suggesting an opportunity for future years.
- The work on pathways was cited in the IPCC 6th assessment report, which included a chapter dedicated to Climate Resilient Development Pathways. This concept brings together adaptation, mitigation, justice, and equity, speaking to the heart of how to realize more desirable futures over time. This is a potential 'thread' that connects multiple projects.

Bruce Currie-Alder, program leader

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

CLARE is one of the most crucial partnerships between IDRC and FCDO, serving as a critical pillar of the three CRFS Program Priorities and drawing from the achievements of CARIAA and other IDRC and FCDO Climate previous programs—the lessons from this bridge-funding initiative contributed to the final design and approval of the CLARE program.

In addition to the results presented by the PO in this PCR and the lessons highlighted by the PL, bridge funding support to some projects is vital in developing and designing significant investments such as CLARE. They allow for exploring new research areas, ensuring sector presence, directly impacting communities, and building a solid business case for donor partners.

These small initiatives enable IDRC (and other donors) to identify emerging issues, test innovative approaches, and refine strategies before committing to larger-scale investments. They demonstrated our commitment to ongoing learning, innovation, and stakeholder engagement, showcasing IDRC's leadership in the Climate Adaptation Research arena.
