Women constitute 75 percent of Kenya's agricultural labor force; however, gender inequalities often undermine their productivity and nutritional wellbeing. Such inequalities include unequal access to and control over land, agricultural technologies, extension services, markets, and climate information. Development projects often address gender gaps in resource allocation, with little focus on unequal gender and social norms. Studies on impacts of gender-transformative approaches to household and community food and nutrition security are scarce in Kenya and other parts of Africa. This research project aims to test two comparable but distinctive approaches and measure their potential for improving gender equality, women's empowerment and food and nutrition security of smallholder farmers. Randomized control trial design will be applied to compare outcomes of the traditional farmer field school approach and the gender-transformative farmer field and business school model. The 30-month study will involve 489 households for close observation while targeting 5,400 (3,000 direct and 2,400 indirect) beneficiaries from Kinangop sub-county, Nyandarua County in Kenya who will benefit from increased agricultural productivity, improved food and nutrition security, improved incomes and more equitable gender and social relations. Through this study, CARE will contribute to bridging existing knowledge gaps on the role of gender in agriculture, promote gender-transformative programming in light of a changing climate, and engage women to realize benefits of productive, profitable and equitable agriculture initiatives.

## Project Highlights

What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

Important results summarized are from the performance of a gender-neutral traditional model of Farmer Field Schools (FFS) that provided demonstraions on improved production and marketing of potato and garden pea crops compared with the performance of a Gender Transformative Farmer Field and Business Schools (GT-FFBS) that added gender and women empowerment plus nutritional behavior change communication to the traditional FSS model. A control group without any intervention was also studied for additional comparison.

## Improved crop yields:

Both the intervention groups (ie GT-FFBS and FFS) benefited from an agronomy curriculum developed by the project to train farmers on good agricultural practises such as mixed-farming and crop diversification along with new economic opportunities through marketing skills. There was a significant increase in yields associated to the adoption of agricultural practises such as ridging for potatoe planting, stringing of garden peas and spacing methods which resulted in greater income and food security. Results from a Participatory Performance Tracker (PPT) assessment revealed that overall 92% of the respondents (7% male and 93% female) were motivated from the demonstrations and adopted ridging potato planting due to higher yields and less labor requirements during weeding and harvesting as well as better yields that contributed to income and for household consumption. Farmers also reported a change of perspective to view farming as a serious business. Additionally, in the gender transformative (GT-FFBS) group, 56% of farmers also established kitchen gardens which contributed to increased diet diversification and healthier diets.

## Income generation:

--- Page 1 ---

The farmer trainings translated to improved farm yields, women's empowerment, increased food and nutrition security at household level and improved marketing skills which led to increased household income. Endline result showed an increase of 8.3% on wealth/income especially among farmers in the gender transformative GT-FFBS cohort. This increase in wealth can be attributed to the increased household income arising from farm yields, better market bargaining power and joint decision making on family income and expenditure.

## Gender equality outcomes:

Gender equality and women's empowerment was estimated using data from an adapted Project-level Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (pro-WEAI) questionnaire at baseline and endline. Gender dialogues conducted during field trainings for the participants in the GT-FFBS group contributed to women's empowerment as demonstrated by more women being involved in household decision making related to income, expenditure and marketing. For example, the proportion of women who made most or all decisions in staple grain farming in GT-FFBS group increased from 67% to 79% between baseline and endline. Significant changes in terms of joint decision making was also reported where both male and female respondents in a household made decisions around family expenditures and shared the proceeds from sale of their farm produce. Additionally, as a result of gender training involving both men and women, respondents reported reduced cases of gender based violence. Overall, findings demonstrate the benefits of the GT-FFBS model in agriculture productivity, livelihoods, women's empowerment and better family dynamics compared to the FSS model with benefits mainly in production and income aspects. The study also identified some continuing gender related issues that need to be addressed. For example, women still had limited ownership of land and other productive resources even though most had access to the land.

## Nutrition and diet quality:

Nutrition modules promoted by the project included seasonal food calendar, food groups, nutrition-sensitive agriculture practices and growing nutritious foods through a kitchen gardens. Assessment of impact of the project on food and nutrition security indicated that both intervention groups had better household diet diversity scores with a slightly better performance among the gender transformative GT-FFBS group while the control group with no intervention showed a decline in their diet quality. This indicates that the improved food availability through better farm yields and incomes in both the intervention models (FSS and GT-FFBS) contributed to better diet, and incorporating nutrition and gender training can shift the trend further in the positive direction though it takes time for significant and lasting changes to occur since food habits change slowly.

## Capacity development:

Another result from the project was enhanced capacity among the project partners, collaborating institution staff and the farmers. Partnership with local governments (via extension workers) strengthened the capacity of 1545 farmers (64% women and 36% men) on agronomy, gender equality &amp; women empowerment, marketing and nutrition. The project also trained a total of 32 lead farmers (or farmer trainers) thereby increasing the critical mass of local expertise in the study area. Partner institutions' capacity to undertake research, dissemination of findings, development of policy briefs and engagement in program related activities such as training of farmers was also enhanced.

Masters Thesis: An Analysis Of Men And Women's Participation In The Potato Value Chain

2 process briefs developed and shared with stakeholders, 2 project policy briefs developed and shared with county executive for further action.

Two Masters students from the Economics Department and African Women Studies Department graduated from UON in December 2019 and are working on sharing their results in 2 scientific papers which are to be shared in the open access once finalised.

Media briefs/features were disseminated to the wider national audience, process briefs, fact sheets, human interest stories were developed. A documentary by the project ran on KTN news (a major media outlet's platform) three successive weeks.

A scientific paper on gender, social relations, and power dynamics is in process to be published after project completion.

If appropriate, explain why outputs were not completed or were of poor quality.

Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

The project was supposed to publish three scientific papers but due to the departure of key technical members of the research team, only one paper was finalized and shared as an annex to the final technical report. Other papers being developed by the project's partners Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization &amp; University of Nairobi along with two other papers from master's students were still in draft stages by the closing of the project. This could be because some of these publications were planned based on the student's academic schedule and graduation requirements.

Another potential reason for the less than anticipated high-quality outcomes was the complex internal functioning of CARE-International's operations through its offices located in different parts of the world. For instance, the project was initially developed under the leadership of CARE-US which had a much

--- Page 3 ---

stronger research and technical capacity, but funding requirements prevented IDRC to work directly through CARE-US. As a result, IDRC's contract was issued through CARE-Canada. However, CARE-Canada did not have the same expertise and knowledge about the project, and despite their best efforts, since key project members were based in the US or Nairobi, it made the management and leadership of the project more complicated. Also, with their main nutrition expert based with CARE-US, the project did not get the timely guidance to implement, monitor and track the diet and nutrition related outcomes.

In spite these limitations, the project was closely monitored by the IDRC PO (Jemimah Njuki) who provided strategic guidance to the research team on gender, and also negotiated with CARE to assign support from their gender expert (Maureen Miruka) who contributed her experience from leading CARE USA's Women in Agriculture flagship program. These measures ensured the project to conclude successfully to the extent possible.

## Project Outcomes

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

As a result of the project's capacity building sessions on improved agricultural practises, marketing, gender and nutrition, the project demonstrated evidence that favors the farmers field school model in general and makes a strong case for integrating gender and nutrition components through the Gender Transformative Farmer Field and Business Schools model.

Key findings include:

56% of the farmers established kitchen gardens which contributed to better diet diversification, a predictor for better nutrition at household level
54% of women in gender transformative group reported being consulted by their spouses for decisions on household income and expenditure, marketing and selection of crops to plant.
25% of women at the end of the project reported increased ability and confidence to provide input for decisions around productive resources.
8.3% of women, especially in gender transformative group, reported in the end line survey an increase of household income and having moved up the wealth ladder (calculated using wealth index matrix).

Farmer's capacity was built around estimating production cost, profits, and doing break even analysis which enabled them to make better agri-business decisions. Further, market research training enabled them to eliminate middlemen and look for market directly which increased their profit margins.

The project was able to also establish research partnerships with other organizations/ institutions such as IITA and Kenya Institute of Public Policy, Research and Analysis. Participation at AGRA 2019 conference provided an opportunity to share results and lessons from the project with policy makers and development partners and an avenue for further collaboration and funding support.

The project partnered with KALRO Tigoni, the Horticulture Research Institute of Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization, to produce certified potato seeds which enabled farmers to access

--- Page 4 ---

the seeds easily. Ability of farmers to use certified seed for production led to increased farm yields as compared to when they used recycled seed.

The project provided evidence on the potential and limitations of the Women Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) for development projects.

How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

Initially, the project targeted working with 20 groups to establish demonstration trials, however, given the strong interest of communities for the project, it ended up supporting 89 groups in establishing demonstration trails, therefore reaching a much higher number of farmer groups/farmers than anticipated.

The project had been funded as a first attempt by AFS to systematically assess women empowerment resulting from the work of the program using the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) methodology.

The findings of this study showed that the project had marginal impact on nutritional security. Though this is expected given the duration of the project and the many dimensions of food and nutrition security, it also points to the need for a multi-sectoral approach and guidance that the project needed to implement the nutrition modules of the intervention.

How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy. Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible

This project was developed and implemented as part of the IDRC's 2015-2020 strategic plan. It contributed to the strategic objective of:

Invest in knowledge and innovation for large-scale positive change: The knowledge from the project by testing the feasibility of an innovative way of integrating gender transformative approaches into traditional farmer field schools approach generated evidence in support of gender transformative food systems interventions. Large-scale positive change is expected through strategic connections and key partnerships established during the course of the project. For example:

The project has a strong synergy with CARE's newly launched 'Women Voices and leadership' (WVL) project funded by Global Affairs Canada. The program which is being implemented in Kenya over a five-year period by CARE in Kenya and partners, aims at contributing to gender equality and increased enjoyment of human rights by women and girls in Kenya. With connections facilitated by IDRC Program Officer, the project learnings on gender equality were shared during the WVL launch workshop with other projects and partners.

The project contributed their gender transformative methodological approaches during a regional conference with the theme of 'A Gendered Approach to Unlocking the Potential for Sustainable Development' organized by Kenya Institute of Public Policy, Research and Analysis (KIPRA). Linkages between the project and KIPPRA have been initiated to share recommendations from the project as

--- Page 5 ---

means to offer evidence to strengthen the gender debate and ultimately contribute to policy recommendations by the Institute.

These contributions also align with IDRC 2030 Strategic objective on Share knowledge for Greater Uptake and Use

Build the leaders for today and tomorrow:

Two MA students from University of Nairobi who received project support completed their thesis and graduated. One of the students, Ruth Wamuyu's degree was in Women, Leadership and Governance in Africa.

The project contributed to developing local leaders within the communities through the concept of farmers as trainers. As a result, 32 farmer trainers (Female=14, Male=19) who successfully completed the training on the required topics (on agronomy, nutrition and gender) also gained communication skills and made a commitment to provide training to fellow farmers. Engaging farmers as trainers and local leaders is likely to promote sustainability of the gender transformative farmer field school model and also ease the workload on the limited number of existing formal extension officers.

Comment: The project was unable to organize meetings to share project policy recommendations with targeted county executive decision makers as anticipated due to limitation of time during the final season when these meeting were intended to happen. The project was therefore unable to advocate for and generate concrete policy changes at the county level. Delays in the implementation of project activities were linked to the combination of constraints associated to the COVID 19 pandemic (restricted mobility and impossibility to hold meetings) and the inability of the project steering committee to meet and guide scaling up as scheduled due to lack of quorum.

Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

Care-Kenya, CARE-US and CARE-Canada are different entities. Granting CARE-Canada as a mechanism to support a project of CARE-US provided a great opportunity to engage experts on Gender transformative research in Food Systems in Kenya but created challenges in term of intellectual ownership for the project

Changes of project manager caused delays in reporting and operations (until a new project manager was put in place) and jeopardized the capacity of the project to complete all intended activities and work on the valuation and uptake of research results.

Two short no-cost extensions (for a total duration of 8 months) were approved over the course of the project to enable the project to

a) complete key activities delayed due to the 2018 drought experienced in Kenya which delayed the onset of 2017/2018 agriculture activities and

recover from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic that has had substantial effect on project operations including a scaling down of field work.

## Strategic Considerations

Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

A medium risk identified in the PAD was that CARE (CARE Canada and CARE Kenya), although an experienced strong development organization, is not research focused which could unintentionally pull them towards focusing more on the implementation and less on the research. Overall, this risk was managed well to a large extent through forging research partnerships with Kenya Agriculture and Livestock Research Organization and the University of Nairobi. However, the less than anticipated research support from CARE-USA remained a challenge. Quarterly meetings among the project partners and the regular monitoring by IDRC Program Officers helped the team to maintain balance

--- Page 7 ---

between research and implementation as well as coordination among the different organizations involved.

Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project?

Project partner institutions involved in the field surveys (KALRO and University of Nairobi) were the lead institutions with research mandates within the country and have developed comprehensive ethics and integrity standards that regulated field data collection, publishing of research findings and disclosure clauses to safeguard the rights and integrity of participating citizens. Required ethics approvals for field research activities were received by the ethics committee constituted by KALRO.

Similarly, protocols for informed consent, privacy and confidentiality, in compliance with national and international standards, were followed when information (e.g. testimonies, primary data, photos) was collected from community members by CARE Kenya.

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

The project was important to fund because inequalities in access and control of resources and low participation of women in decision making often undermine the contribution of women within the food system even though they constitute 75 percent of Kenya's agricultural labour force. While gender transformative approaches are gaining prominence, there is a paucity of evidence on how to systematically integrate these approaches in agriculture and food security programming.

This project contributed to the body of evidence important for policy makers and development practitioners by investigating and sharing results on how the gender transformative approaches of incorporating gender modules to the conventional farmer field and business schools' modules can benefit both agriculture productivity, empowerment of women and gender equality.
