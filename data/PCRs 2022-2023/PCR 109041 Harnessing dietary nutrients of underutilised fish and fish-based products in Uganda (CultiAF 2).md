# Project Abstract

Nutritional deficiencies are widespread in rural and urban poor communities of Uganda, particularly among women of reproductive age and children under 5 years. Fisheries and aquaculture offer opportunities to reduce hunger, improve nutrition, alleviate poverty and generate economic growth. However, fish has become less available to Ugandans due to declining stocks of large fishes coupled with high exports and post-harvest losses. There is a need to improve the handling and processing to develop nutritious, affordable and safe fish-based products accessible to vulnerable groups.

The goal of NutriFish was to increase availability, accessibility and consumption of under-utilized small fishes and processing by-products for sustainable food and nutrition security and better livelihoods of vulnerable groups in Uganda. The project worked along the fish production and its associated value chains to address the nutritional needs of vulnerable groups who cannot afford expensive large commercial fishes but critically need high quality nutritious diets. Through improved post-harvest and processing technologies, the research found ways to reduce losses and increase product quality, safety, and acceptability, and improve its distribution among populations living far from water bodies. Considering that women are often excluded from profitable ventures and are late adopters of technologies and innovation, this project ensured that product development, marketing and entrepreneurship strategies included women to enhance their economic capacities, acceptance and adoption of fish and its by-products within their diets.

At the end of the project, consumers from lower income segments of Uganda's population were able to access affordable and nutritious fish-based products. Through increased consumption of higher quality protein from fish and improved dietary diversity, the project contributed to reducing the incidence of micronutrient deficiencies, especially among women of reproductive age and children under 5 years. It has also created diversified income opportunities through enterprise development in fishing, fish processing and marketing.

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

1. Sustainability of the fisheries sector: Overfishing can lead to a depletion of an invaluable resource in the fisheries sector. To ensure sustainable exploitation and management of the under-utilized small fishes (USFs) in Uganda - Engraulicypris bredoi (muziri), Brycinus nurse (ragoogi) and Rastrineobola argentea (mukene) - a simple mobile phone-based application (App.) known as electronic Catch Assessment Survey (eCAS) was developed. The App., freely accessible through the Google Play Store, is being used by trained local enumerators to collect fisheries data in real time, including fish catch quantity, type of fishing nets and boats used, and how much money the fishers expect to earn. The monitoring of fish catches and licensing of fishing boats will ensure sustainable management. The web-based version of the App. can be accessed on http://beta.smartcas.net. With the potential to accommodate an unlimited number of datasets including fisheries surveys, aquaculture, socio-economics and marketing, the system is an invaluable resource for the sustainable development of fisheries for wealth creation, employment and food security. By April 2023, 20 enumerators had been trained, and 12,000 records of catch data had been collected and transmitted through the system, an important step in real-time data capture, analysis and timely reporting. The Directorate of Fisheries Resources and the Fisheries Protection Unit, which rely on the data to help control fishing effort is using the app and has increased the frequency, accuracy, and reliability of data collection. This has also reduced the annual cost of data collection by about 80% (from about US$106,340 to US$21,270).

2. Gender transformative approaches: To address persistent inequalities in the USF value chain, the project conducted both quantitative and qualitative Pro-WEAI baseline survey. These showed disempowerment of women from factors such as self-efficacy, attitudes about domestic violence, control over use of income, work balance, group membership, membership in influential groups, autonomy in income, and respect among household members. The baseline information helped design behavioural change campaigns, product development, Gender Transformative Actions (GTA) and training of value chain actors. From these interventions group savings increased by 100% through internally generated member contributions (revolving funds). This improved access to financial resources needed to sustain businesses and meet family needs like taking children to better schools, improving the standards of living and purchasing assets such as livestock. Cases of domestic violence reduced by about 75% as more community members were sensitized and became aware of the ills of the vice. Group membership grew by 20.3% as more women joined various groups while the number of men involved in household role sharing (including cooking) also increased from 15 to 20%. Betty Mercy Timbe, a female champion from Ntoroko landing site on Lake Albert mobilized 11 women into forming the Ntoroko Women Mukene Fishers Association who now own seven boats and have been able to enhance their earnings to an estimated US$1,200 per month from fish-trading activities. The women are using the incomes to meet their family needs and expand their businesses. Some Champions helped to establish enterprise groups for collective production, processing, and marketing with over 70 boats coming together in Lake Kyoga, hence increasing average monthly production to 3.7 tons, translating to a gross value of about USD 7,000. The training also increased nutritional awareness leading to 20-30% increase in consumption of the USFs.

3. Boosting Nutrition: Results from the nutrient analysis and safety informed the development of five high-value nutritious fish-enriched products (baby food, maize meal, sauce, seasoning and snacks), to enhance local diet diversity. To inform product formulation, the project conducted nutrient analysis of USFs and Nile perch processing by-products with emphasis on micronutrients (Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, P, Se, and Zn) and safety indicators (Cd, Pb, Hg, and organochlorides). Results showed that all three USFs contain high levels of essential nutrients (Calcium, Iron, and Zinc) and fall within a safe

range (≤0.05 ppb) for non-essential elements recommended by WHO. The USFs, therefore, play an important role in addressing nutritional deficiencies in Uganda, thus the importance of increasing their availability, accessibility, and consumption, particularly among vulnerable groups in Uganda. The products developed were accepted in five supermarkets in Kampala. To increase reach to the vulnerable mothers and children, the products were introduced in five government-owned health facilities located in low-income areas of Kampala District. The fish sauce cooks in only 10 minutes compared to three hours required to cook beans thus saving time and energy, which are key challenges to food preparation, especially among low-income earners. The reduced energy requirement is also beneficial to environmental conservation. The private sector component, Nutreal, enhanced capacity for bulk production and packaging to improve the safety and esthetic characteristics of the products to meet market and regulatory demands. In addition, two other fish-enriched products were developed as part of a PhD research (NutriFish bar for pregnant women and Nutribuji for children). Results for the NutriBuji containing 45% small fishes increased iron level in malnourished children by 17% over period of 21 days.

4. Policy engagement: The project engaged policy makers to realise two main goals: 1) develop a sustainable approach to the fisheries sector in Uganda and the surrounding countries as lakes are transboundary. The availability of the data on E-CAS is helping in monitoring of fish catches and licensing of fishing boats, thus ensuring sustainable management. The project has recommended the App. to the Directorate of Fisheries Resources for promotion and adoption for all Ugandan lakes and regionally. Secondly, to develop products for market, the team had to meet the regulators requirements on food safety. Thus, the project engaged the regulatory body, the Uganda Bureau of Standards, as a key stakeholder throughout the project. All five products currently in the market have been certified by the Uganda National Bureau of Standards (UNBS). This took longer than the anticipated time but Nutreal, the private sector company had to follow the protocols required to achieve this outcome. From this a mukene cookbook, containing 16 recipes rich in protein, calcium, zinc, and iron was also developed and endorsed by the Minister of State for Fisheries and is available for download at the NutriFish website (www.nutrifish.mak.ac.ug).

5. Post Harvest handling: inappropriate and inadequate handling and processing facilities render a portion of USFs unavailable for human consumption. The unavailability is further exacerbated by rain leading to massive losses. Estimated physical loss for mukene is 12% translating into financial loss of $29 per ton of dried fish. Physical losses are common at the fishing grounds, landing and drying sites due to spillage, unintended abandonment, consumption by birds and other animals. Quality loss is 61% during high catch season, representing a financial loss of $505 per ton of dried fish. For muziri, physical loss is 9% during high catch season translating to financial loss $18.4 per ton of dried fish while quality loss is 38% during high catch season with a financial loss of $332 per ton of dried fish. To reduce this loss solar dryers were constructed to reduce the risk of contamination and provide clean and efficient storage and processing. These reduced the drying duration from eight to four hours for mukene and muziri and from three days to one day for ragooge. They doubled incomes of women fish processors/traders from US$1 to US$2/kg, and tripled shelf-life to almost five months. As a result, national and regional organizations such as the Lake Victoria Fisheries Organization, Equatorial Power Ltd., Mountain Harvest, Katosi Women Group, and Kasavex Enterprises Limited have expressed interest to upscale the technology. The driers also attracted the attention of policymakers, with the Sectoral Committee of Parliament on Agriculture, Animal Industry, and Fisheries specifically recommending their use in April 2022 for improving fish processing.

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

Compared to other protein sources, fish offers superior protein quality, omega-3 fatty acids and higher concentrations of bioavailable minerals and vitamins that are critical for health. Fish has become less available and accessible, however, because of declining catches of large fishes (&gt;20 cm, total length), increased regional and international demand, high post-harvest losses and gender inequalities. This project was seeking to make fish more available, accessible and increase consumption for better food security of vulnerable populations while ensuring that this would be available for generations to come.

Monitoring tools for better policy making – the project, in conjunction with the Department of Fisheries developed a monitoring tool, E-CAS that can aggregate for all lakes in Uganda the type of fish, the gear used, the licensed boats, the economic value of the fisheries sector, taking the guess work out of planning. By the end of April 2023, a total of 12,200 records of catch data had been collected and transmitted through the system by the trained 14 local enumerators (13 men and 1 woman) for archiving at the backup servers based at NaFIRRI. The monthly data sets have improved the precision with which catches of the USF are estimated. The results show a

significant difference in the catch per unit effort during the different seasons (New moon, Quarter moon, Full moon, and Third Quarter moon). The Directorate of Fisheries Resources (DiFR) and Fisheries Protection Unit are using the information to guide on the appropriate fishing effort thus ensuring sustainability of the fisheries sector. This tool is being used to monitor lake resources and control overfishing that can destabilize lake resources. Using this digital platform has saved resources by reducing by half the cost of data collection around the lakes in Uganda and ensuring that lake resources are used appropriately.

**The Champion model for sustainable transformation**: Since transformation is a gradual process, the project engaged and trained "Champions" to facilitate local groups (platforms) through meetings. The project developed Gender Transformative Actions (GTA) for addressing underlying behaviors, practices, social norms and power relations in order to achieve gender equality and empowerment. The transformation process included piloting the solar tent dryer and raised fish drying racks as women-friendly drudgery reducing processing technologies, conducting social and behavioral change interventions using gender transformative tools that included theater for development, sensitizing communities on role sharing by engaging men specifically, training on group dynamics, entrepreneurship and financial literacy, and conducting nutrition education using the small fishes cookbook. Champions were trained on gender at the three landing sites and helped to lead group activities independent of the physical presence of project staff. Nambawa Daisy, a youth who trained as a champion, says the project has created employment throughout the entire value chain. "The boat owner gets money from the boat, and fishers get income from bringing the fish. Young men earn money from transporting the fish to the drying area, women are paid to spread the fish on the drying racks, and the store owner gets paid for storing the fish." These Champions will continue to transform their respective communities beyond the lifespan of the project.

**Increased consumption of fish products for better dietary diversity** – To enable intake of fish, the project tested and released into the market 5 products that can be consumed on their own as snacks or used as ingredients in other products thereby delivering a nutrition in ways that do not damage the environment by using fuel wood and requiring too much water. Female youth were recruited to conduct awareness sessions, including sensory testing at supermarkets, during exhibitions, promotional events and at street vendor stalls. The products have so far been accepted in five supermarkets in Kampala with a total sales volume of 3,498 pieces, predominantly purchased by women of reproductive age for themselves and their infants and young children. The product sales volumes with limited promotion are: baghia snack - 1,420 pieces of 50 g servings; seasoning - 886 pieces useable in about 2,700 meals; baby food - 670 pieces/meals (of 50 g packs of instant flour) and 522 packs of fish sauce (each sufficient for a meal). To facilitate wider distribution, Nutreal is finalizing an agreement with a female entrepreneur specialized in marketing of baby food products, with a network of up to 85% sales points country wide and 80% of health center facilities. To popularize the small fishes and increase their consumption among different communities, the project, in collaboration with key stakeholders, developed a small fishes cookbook (www.nutrifish.mak.ac.ug) and used it to conduct food preparation demonstration sessions for the fishing community members at Kiyindi, Dei and Kikondo landing sites. This has helped to promote consumption of the small fishes in diverse forms, particularly by the vulnerable groups (women of childbearing age and children below the age of five). Consumption of small fish increased by about 20%. Involvement of men in the cooking demonstration led to an increase in household role sharing by men (including cooking) from 15-30% to 20-50%. Financial allocation for food has also increased from 2,000 Uganda Shillings (US$ 0.6) previously to 5,000-10,000 Shillings (US$1.5-3) daily.

**Awards and recognition**: In recognition of the contribution to the growth of the fisheries sector, NutriFish won a regional Fisheries Innovations Award 2023 organized by the Sustainable Fisheries Initiative –SFI (https://news.mak.ac.ug/2023/07/nutrifish-wins-fisheries-innovations-award-2023/).

5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

The project achieved remarkable success even when faced with challenges of COVID-19 that hampered operations for the better part of 2020 and 2021. The project team made adjustments accordingly and continued to engage the community through digital platforms. The results point to the resilience of the project team and a deep-seated desire to see food security realised for the vulnerable communities in Uganda.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC’s strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.

Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

1. Invest in knowledge and innovation for large scale positive change. This project identified a significant challenge that is and could be a significant developmental challenge going forward in Uganda and used the locally available resources, fisheries and human resources to develop a solution. The solution to make fisheries sustainable, products accessible, and develop processing capabilities that will see products developed and consumed well into the future a reality was undertaken in very challenging COVID-19 times but very successfully. The outcomes will be felt well into the future and evidently policy was be made based on the tools developed in this project to protect the fisheries sector for Uganda and the countries that share the lakes and the resources within them.

2. Building leaders of today and tomorrow — The project incorporated Four PhD and four MSc students to undertake scopes of work in the project. The students have been trained and skilled in various research areas including cross cutting/multidisciplinary courses, such as Gender and use of Project Level Women Empowerment in Agricultural Index (Pro-WEAI). They presented at various international conferences such as the Joint Aquatic Sciences Meeting (JASM), at Grand Rappids, Michigan, USA in 2022, the Annual Agriculture, Nutrition and Health (ANH) Academy e-conference in 2022; and the International Conference on Artisanal Fisheries and Aquaculture (ICAFA), Jinja Uganda in 2022. One PhD student won two research grants; the first from IDRC on Women, Peace and Security; and the second from the African Development Bank African Climate Change Fund, titled “Strengthening the Voices of Women with Disability to Actively Participate in Climate Change Policy and Negotiations”. These awards are invaluable in ensuring that students apply knowledge and skills gained in real-life context and ensure sustainability of project impacts.

The partnership modalities and which team is responsible for what in a project makes for a good lesson. The socio-economic team responsible for PRO-WEAI either did not plan properly or were unwilling to undertake the endline with the funds available which caused some rifts in the team. Makerere picked up this piece towards the end to do what they could to conclude the project. But also, a lesson on when to introduce a tool that is human and financial resource heavy as it could end up being a very difficult issue to manage going forward.

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

The COVID pandemic was not on the radar at the time of approval but the project team and the IDRC teams were able to steer this project to completion. Perhaps some recognition of unanticipated shocks and the contingencies that could be put in play could be considered and what adjustments could be made should these destabilising shocks occur considered during project development.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

NO

## Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

The PCR rightfully highlights the significance of proper planning and allocating funds for project activities to avoid conflicts within the team and ensure the successful completion of all project components as per the plan. Moreover, the PO emphasizes the importance of introducing tools that are not excessively dependent on human resources, time, labour, and expertise to operate, maintain and manage financially. These learnings should guide future IDRC programs involving partnerships and complex tools.

The project positively impacted access to financial resources crucial for running businesses and meeting family needs, such as sending children to better schools, improving living standards, and buying assets like livestock. The project, as per the Cultiaf framework and following IDRC best practices in gender equality, also empowered women by addressing factors that disempowered them, including self-efficacy, attitudes towards domestic violence, control over the use of income, work-life balance, group membership, membership in influential groups, autonomy in income, and respect among household members.
