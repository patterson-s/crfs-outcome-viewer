# Project Abstract

The Mozambique government and other development partners have invested significant efforts to revitalize and expand smallholder irrigation schemes in the country as a strategy to improve agricultural productivity, increase food security, reduce poverty, and increase resilience to climate variability. This is in addition to farmer-led irrigation schemes that have been estimated to be at least twice the size of government-funded smallholder irrigation, making them the largest contributor to irrigation in Mozambique. However, both types of irrigation are challenged by rapid degradation and underutilization of infrastructure, conditions that are further exacerbated by more frequent extreme natural disasters such as floods, droughts, and cyclones. The farmer-led smallholder irrigation in Mozambique (FASIMO) project sought to better understand both types of irrigation by documenting their successes and failures, through a gender lens, and to develop irrigation development models that would transform irrigation into being more productive, self-sustaining, and equitable.

Using participatory approaches, including selected modules of the Project-based Women Empowerment in Agriculture Index (Pro-WEAI), the project team conducted a comparative analysis of the two types of schemes to understand how the management, formal and informal institutional arrangements, and business models impacted the functioning of the schemes. The findings informed a suite of user-driven interventions (business models) that included capacity building of water use associations (WUAs), linking WUAs to extension services, private sector and markets, and introduction of soil water monitoring tools. Recommendations of successful business models were disseminated through policy briefs and stakeholder workshops, with some innovations being adopted and scaled by users.

Of note, soil water monitoring tools stood out as a critical innovation capable of revolutionizing the irrigation sector locally and globally. The tool promotes water use efficiency (reduces water volume and costs for fuel pumps, increases crop yields), can be used by all farmers in their diversity, and was appreciated by men and women for saving time and money. Women were able to recoup time for attending to household work. The colour codes of the instrument can be easily interpreted even by illiterate farmers. This tool was adopted by other projects and programs by project closure.

# PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

(1) Introduced and popularized digital soil water monitoring tools (water sensors and wetting front detectors). The tools were introduced by the project as a new efficient water use technology to farmers, extension workers, and other stakeholders in the two target provinces. The tools led to positive impacts on the target irrigation schemes. Using the WMTs, farmers cut water usage by half and reduced irrigation costs by 40% while increasing crop yields by 10% in two consecutive seasons (2020 and 2021). Sitoe, a horticultural farmer from a women-dominated irrigation scheme testified, "We used to water our fields every day and this was costly in terms of fuel for the pumps (34,889 Mozambique metical, CAD 700), time, and labor to cover 4 ha over one cropping season. Now, we are only irrigating twice a week based on the readings from the Chameleon, reducing the irrigation costs to about 14,354 Mozambique metical, CAD 288." Farmers invested the money and time saved in other activities such as farming in dryland areas, household activities, and income-generating activities. A gendered analysis of these activities showed that women re-invested their saved time in household activities while men tended to do heavy-duty activities such as land clearing for agriculture purposes. The soil water monitoring tools also have enormous potential for changes in practices and policies.

(2) GIS models for mapping irrigated areas. The project also developed cost-effective models to identify and map irrigated areas in Mozambique using remote sensing. The models show that there is a lot of irrigated agriculture in the country and that farmer-led irrigation systems are more abundant than government-led irrigation systems. The algorithms developed by the project successfully identify irrigation hotspots where active water management is taking place. Such findings are very useful to the National Irrigation Institute (INIR) in identifying new sites/places where farmers are irrigating, monitoring existing irrigated areas, and in planning targeted development interventions.

(3) Gender differences and women empowerment. Women and men's perceptions regarding selected Pro-WEAI empowerment domains indicated that: (i) male farmers exert greater control and autonomy over resources such as land, assets, and income compared to women, however, widows are entitled to the same level of control and autonomy over these resources; (ii) there is a widespread acknowledgment of the existing imbalance in the workload between female and male farmers; (iii) within the study sites, men own more land (0.8-1.0 ha) compared to women (0.2 ha), and control irrigated land, in both farmer-led and government-led schemes. Women have more access to rain-fed land, which is also controlled by men, but can own and control the land if they are widowed. They also have access to irrigated plots if they are members of an irrigation scheme. For example, in Gaza province, women's participation in irrigation schemes is above 50% because men have migrated to South Africa for other jobs; while in Manica, women's participation in irrigation is about 30%. Also, women participate actively and have greater opportunities to irrigate when irrigation systems are simple, e.g., using surface flow or gravity schemes, not complex such as those combining infrastructure and knowledge-intensive technologies. If using motor pumps, for example, only 40% of women carry out irrigation with support from their family members, who run the pumps. Although soil water and nutrient monitoring tools contributed to reduce the burden and workload of both female and male farmers, women benefited more, compared to men, because they reduced women's burden at

household level. For example, daily calendars showed that women spend time working with their husbands in the field, and there after shoulder all the household chores - fetch water and firewood, cook, clean, and take care of children. For instance, with the use of tools, Ms. Sofia Johane went from a 2-day irrigation interval, to a flexible and on demand irrigation schedule of 4-7 days on her cabbage plot. This gave her more time to take care of her 5 children and manage household chores. These findings affirm the importance of doing a gender analysis for every context but also inform that irrigation initiatives need to be intentionally designed to address gender differences.

(4) Factors influencing success and failure of irrigation schemes. Research results showed that in most of the irrigation schemes, smallholder farmers have limited knowledge of irrigation management techniques, and lack training and technical assistance. Also, there is the poor performance of contractors who carry out design, construction, and supervision work; weak farmer organizations that are mostly promoted by external entities and therefore not self-sustaining; limited coverage and technical capacity of extension services to deal with matters related to irrigation management. Furthermore, farmers have limited connections to markets, especially those focusing on subsistence agriculture. Successful irrigation schemes and initiatives must address these gaps.

(5) Models for improving irrigation in Mozambique. The project tested and documented models with the potential to improve the performance of irrigation schemes in Mozambique. Findings show that key aspects of the models include:

(i) Involve farmers as key decision-makers in designing, implementing, and managing the irrigation scheme.
(ii) Establish transparent and democratic governance structures such as the Water User Associations (WUA) or Farmer Associations.
(iii) Training of irrigation leaders and ordinary farmers on infrastructure management and improved agronomic practices.
(iv) DUAT (the law that provides a right to use land that is inheritable) increased the ownership of the investments in the irrigation scheme and triggered an increase of cultivated land in some irrigation schemes.
(v) Use of agricultural technologies (e.g., inputs, improved agronomic practices) and linkage to markets are important means to enhance the sustainability of irrigation schemes.
(vi) The introduction of cash crops can increase resilience to climate impacts in smallholder farming.

3. If appropriate, explain why outputs were not completed or were of poor quality.

Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

The project missed a huge opportunity to use the results of the project to meaningfully influence irrigation policymaking. First, Covid-19 disrupted the project course. Southern Africa has one major rainy season (November -March) and if this season is lost, a whole year is wasted. The team lagged in bouncing back and needed handholding and a redesign of implementation strategies. Secondly, the research team suffered a turnover of PIs. When the first PI, who had developed and knew the project well left, the new one found challenges of simultaneously learning about the project and coordinating its implementation. Thirdly, the implementing team was scattered across the globe (Africa, Australia, and Europe). Because of the inability to travel due to COVID-19, the partners in Canberra and the Netherlands focused on their pieces of work (Monitoring and evaluation and GIS, respectively), with limited meshing and operating as one team. Therefore, the policy engagement activities were limited to stakeholder dissemination workshops and the distribution of technical papers and policy briefs.

The advantage is that INIR, the National Institute of Irrigation, which is charged with the mandate of irrigation development, was a research partner and has access to all the outputs. This presents an opportunity to make use of the knowledge that was generated on this project.

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

The project was important to fund because both the Mozambican government and its development partners have significantly invested to revitalize and expand the smallholder irrigated agriculture. Mozambique's 25-year national irrigation program aims to irrigate an additional 200,000 hectares of land to help smallholder farmers increase production and weather climate vagaries.

The INIR report of 2016 showed that only half of the 181,000 hectares of Government-led irrigation infrastructure is currently operational. Scientific evidence confirms that smallholder irrigation technologies introduced in Mozambique often result in failures due to poor maintenance by their users, resulting in rapid degradation and underutilization of irrigation infrastructure. Additionally, there is a vibrant farmer-led irrigation culture in the country that is neither sufficiently recognized nor recognized. Another constraint to the irrigation sector in Mozambique is the limited availability of irrigation water owing to the impacts of climate change. There has been prolonged droughts, resulting in the suspension of irrigation in some urban and peri-urban localities and water use conflicts in rural areas. Yet the government does not know the total irrigated area and the amount of water used for irrigation. This restricts its ability to plan and manage water use and resolve conflicts. The project was designed to generate and share evidence and innovations that could be

used by all irrigation stakeholders and support irrigation policymaking. The innovations and knowledge would contribute to transforming irrigation making it more productive, self-sustaining, and equitable to users.

The project's three main contributions that have potential to transform the irrigation sector are summarized below. Details are in section 1 (project highlights).

- The gendered evidence generated shows that women have more access to irrigation if they belong to a water use association, the irrigation technology is simple to learn and use, and if they own land or have clear land use rights. These and other gendered context specific factors must be taken into consideration when designing irrigation schemes, establishing user institutions, and developing land policy.
- The evidence on factors that ensure success in irrigation schemes and those that constrain performance or lead to collapse are important to inform the development of irrigation initiatives in the country, including guidance in day-to-day practice.
- The soil water monitoring tools. In one case study, the Rivoningo scheme, farmers reported halving the number of irrigation events, from applying water daily to every 2 to 3 days, resulting in saving $200/ha/season on average, money that was formerly used to buy fuel and rent labour, accounting for a reduction of costs from 30,000 MZN (CAD 603) per season per ha to 19,000 MZN (CAD 384) per season per hectare. Although farmers reduced their water footprint, they increased their yields and thus doubled their water productivity. As a result, farmers in who did not have water monitoring tools adopted the irrigation interval used by those with tools in almost all irrigation schemes. By project closure in December 2022, these tools were adopted and implemented by the Small-scale Irrigation and Market Access (IRRIGA) and the Water Productivity (WaPOR) projects, funded by World Bank and FAO, respectively. Other projects using the tools included APSAN VALE and Transforming Irrigation in Southern Africa (TISA) funded by Agencia do Zambeze and ACIAR respectively.
- The cost-effective models developed by the project to identify and map irrigated areas in Mozambique using remote sensing are important to monitor existing irrigation initiatives, identify new irrigated sites/areas, and plan targeted interventions accordingly. In addition to building the capacity of the INIR staff, these models will be used by the INIR institute for evidence informed practice and to improve irrigation policing.
- The project leveraged the Digital Earth Africa (DE Africa, https://www.digitalearthafrica.org/) a digital platform that allows for carrying out several analyses using Landsat and Sentinel satellite images, and cloud-coding and imagery processing in a user-friendly environment. The results from the analysis can inform decision-making and the formulating of policies and interventions, such as monitoring crop health, level of water stress, monitoring and forecasting agricultural seasons, map irrigation, and more.

# 5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

The project evolved with various adjustments largely due to the COVID19 pandemic. One key change was the inability to set up and use stakeholder platforms to scale project interventions among many users. Instead, farmer exchange visits were established to foster learning. Additionally, to create resilience among farmers during the pandemic, a revolving input credit initiative was introduced to targeted irrigation schemes. A digital tool was also developed to provide extension advisory services for farmers. The two initiatives were aligned to contribute to the original project objective of testing models that would improve profitability for farmers.

Objective 3 of the project was to test innovative and user driven business and farmer organizational models that are equitable and that improve profitability for farmers engaged in the government funded and farmer led smallholder irrigation schemes. The project team

experienced delays in analysing the socio-economic data that was intended to inform the protocols for testing. As a result, the project tested models singly and in various schemes but there was no chance to test all the factors in one scheme that could serve as a case study.

6. How did this project contribute one or more of IDRC’s strategic objectives?
Refer to the Strategic Plan. Provide specific numbers where possible.

The study was developed and implemented as part of the IDRC’s 2015-2020 strategic plan. The project contributed to strategic objective of investing in knowledge and innovation for large scale positive change. Section 4 above has elaborated how the generated evidence is being used by different irrigation stakeholders, and the potential of the innovations for wider use and impact for the irrigation sector in Mozambique and beyond.

The project also contributed to building leaders for today and tomorrow. A total of 63 farmers (37 women, 26 men), representing various irrigation schemes, were trained in installation, reading and interpretation of the results of the soil moisture and nutrient monitoring tools, and had tools installed in their fields. These remain in the communities as a reserve force and can train other farmers. A total of 20 extension workers and teaching staff were trained in how to identify, map and monitor irrigated agriculture using remote sensing techniques. The participants were also introduced to the Digital Earth Africa (DE Africa) platform and how to use it for any needed analyses using Landsat and Sentinel. A total of 45 farmers and 15 government and NGO extension staff participated cross-scheme exchange visits, sharing knowledge on technical field practices, scheme organizational issues (genesis, structure, operation), acquisition of agricultural inputs and marketing of produce, and strategies to sustain the interactions of farmers after project closure.

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

Even though the Covid-19 pandemic was not anticipated as a risk and therefore not planned for during project development, the adjustments made jointly by the project team and the CultiAF team helped to salvage the project from major drawbacks. In future, risk assessments could consider analysing major crises, including those known to be prevalent in project localities. For example, Mozambique suffers recurrent droughts, cyclones, and flooding. If these had been identified as potential risks and mitigation measures put in place, the same strategies would have significantly reduced the Covid-19 impacts.

The restriction that projects cannot spend after formal project closure, based on grant agreement contracts, needs to be administered with flexibility. This project, and others in the CultiAF portfolio, were not able to conclude knowledge dissemination activities and could not support scaling initiatives, which would have been important for creating impact. Additionally, in practice, some activities continue after project closure, including scientific publications, and such progress is never captured in final technical reports because there are no mechanisms in place to track progress when active engagement with teams ceases. Allowing projects to stay with some budget to continue and conclude e.g., knowledge translation and policy engagement activities would be important to enable scaling.

# STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

The performance of the risk mitigation measures variable were variable. The strategy to engage farmers and extension workers on water monitoring tools at the start of the project was effective. Farmers were able to learn, apply and the tools were scaled to other initiatives.

The project team had not anticipated weather related risks and no mitigation measures were put in place. Project implementation was thus constrained by floods, tropical

depression, and cyclones. Floods swept off the water monitoring tools in some localities, causing a loss of data for an entire season, in addition to replacement costs.

Due to multiple partnerships across three continents and three local teams located in Maputo and in two distant provinces, and the complexity of the project design (interrogating technical, social and institutional, and governance) and innovations, the team anticipated risks associated to integration. Integration strategies were moderately effective because Covid-19 made it difficult for teams to meet. Some progress was made using virtual meetings and hiring M&amp;E personnel locally to implement the MEL framework, but the project would have done better if physical engagement happened. Physical interactions would have helped to bridge capacity gaps among the local research teams.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

There were no issues related to ethics. At the beginning of the project, the research team took time to secure ethical approval from Universidade Eduardo Mondlane's Scientific Board after assessing the quality of all academic and research activities, the proposal, and research team qualifications. Implementation moved smoothly thereafter.

## Program Leader / Manager comments
Program Leaders/Managers should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

## Director comments
The relevant Program or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

The FASIMO project in Mozambique provides some strategic lessons for the transformation of food systems as IDRC transitioned from the AE to the CRFS program. The project highlighted the importance of participatory approaches and gender-sensitive analysis in understanding the functioning of smallholder irrigation schemes and developing user-driven interventions. As presented in the PCR by the PO, the project emphasized the need for innovative and cost-effective technologies, such as digital soil water monitoring tools, to improve water use efficiency and increase crop yields.

This initiative underscores the importance of building the capacity of water use associations (WUAs) and linking them to extension services, the private sector, and markets to enhance the sustainability of irrigation schemes. The PCR highlights the need for flexible and adaptive project management to respond to unexpected challenges, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and climate variability.

As we move to new series of interventions in Southern Africa, it is important to learn the lessons from this project about how to emphasize the importance of evidence-based policy development and changes in practices for government and multilateral agencies to support the transformation of food systems.
