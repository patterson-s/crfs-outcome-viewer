# Project Highlights

What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

Climate Smart Villages and household resilience methodology:

The project generated evidence to support the climate-smart villages (CSV) model as a platform to implement climate smart agriculture (CSA) practices towards resilience, women's empowerment, equity, and sustainable food systems. With a methodology called Household Resilience Score (HRS) developed by the project helped to compute and understand resilience in the context of CSA. Computation of HRS in six CSV sites in the three project countries (Philippines, Cambodia and Myanmar) revealed a positive relationship of HRS factors such as the number of climate-smart interventions adopted by the household, available land area, coping strategies score and food security score. Within the HRS sub-components, the food security score is influenced by household resilience, access to basic services, social safety nets, adaptive capacity, and women empowerment score. Analysis of data also indicated that HRS can be a feasible methodology to monitor or track household resilience as an outcome of climate change-related interventions.

Women's empowerment and inequalities:

An investigation into the contribution of CSA to women's economic empowerment within the climate smart villages revealed several interesting insights. Findings indicate the contribution of CSA to women's economic empowerment through increased levels of income which they contribute to the household, increased participation in joint decision-making on production and major household expenditures, and more active participation of women in trainings and community activities. Interestingly, women who were participating in CSV activities were more engaged with their male counterparts in decision making related to small livestock such as goats, pigs and chickens because they gained experience and knowledge through the interventions. On the contrary, the study also identified continued wage inequality between men and women (women earning 30% less wages than men farmers) as well as time poverty of women in the CSVs with an average of 15.2 hours per day that women spend on economic activities (wage employment and farm work) and housework.

Social learning methods and opportunities:

The project demonstrated the feasibility and importance of social learning methods for farmers (i.e. learning through observation of other people's behavior) for the diffusion of CSA techniques. In the context of CSVs, these participatory methods are important because they helped nurture the capacities of farmers to identify, test and improve climate adaptation options from a portfolio of proven technologies shared by the project team. When participating farmers in the CSVs identified and tested a menu of adaptation options, it triggered an increase in the number of adopters of the technologies. Late adopters were convinced to test the interventions because they had witnessed for themselves the beneficial impacts on the early adopters.

Cost-benefit analysis:

Project results contributed to fill the gaps in data on costs (direct and indirect) and benefits (economic, ecological and social) for the various climate smart practices. Cost-benefit analysis carried out for farming practices adopted in different agro-ecological locations of the project sites indicate a favourable

case for the CSV model as a financially sustainable model. For example, the CSA options adopted by participating households in Southern Shan of Myanmar included yield enhancement of upland rice and corn, fruit-tree-based homesteads and farm agroforestry, vegetable gardening, and homestead livestock and poultry farming. Results showed that a large majority of the households benefited financially from adopting the interventions. Collectively, the total net benefit generated ranged from MMK 73.88 Million (USD 44,640) to MMK 126.35 Million (USD 76,344) per year in a Climate Smar Village. Moreover, the study found that the CSV approach supported benefits such as economic empowerment, household food security, and gender responsiveness.

Social protection measures: Along with testing the CSV model, the project also documented the role of community based institutions such as village loans and savings associations for meeting short- and long term financial needs of small holder farmers to cope with shocks such as adverse climate events. Indepth case study analysis of a Village Development Fund and Savings Group (VDFSG) in Cambodia indicated their usefulness during crop failures caused by extreme weather events or household medical emergencies. This community operated group also encourages savings among members as a tool to address poverty. The case study also identified ways in which the VDFSG leadership and governance capacity of this local resource can be strengthened through external monitoring and guidance to ensure efficient operations.

## Project Outcomes

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

The research was important to fund because a key action recommended by the development community in response to climate variability and extremes is to strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity of food systems and people's livelihoods. After ten years of trial and error, the climate smart agriculture (CSA) movement has generated enough evidence that the approach could be implemented across a wide range of biophysical, socioeconomic and cultural contexts. However, lack of information regarding the associated costs and expected benefits from such investments was slowing down the rate of expansion. This project deployed participatory action research relying on diverse socio-technical methods for facilitating community-level adaptation in climate-smart villages and documented some of the missing evidence. The financial and social benefits, costs, and trade-offs of the technologies were assessed, and promising interventions were made available to government and non-government entities for scaling up to locations with similar agroecological characteristics.

Evidence generated as a result of the project revealed that the CSV approach has contributed to supporting climate change adaptation in agriculture, household resilience, women's economic empowerment, social inclusion, and food security. Some of the CSV approaches, especially the promotion of homestead gardening and small livestock farming helped minimize the negative effects of COVID-19 pandemic on food security caused due to disruptions to transportation and supply chain.

The capacity building activities integrated into the project helped communities, partners, and stakeholders to understand and support the long-term viability of CSVs and CSA, preparing them to better respond to the impacts of negative climate events. Information generated is well-positioned to influence investments in the region including, for example, by the ASEAN secretariat which is active in promoting CSA.

How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

The main challenges experienced by the team during the project implementation were due to restrictions against COVID-19 in Cambodia, Myanmar, and the Philippines, in addition to the ongoing political situation in Myanmar which resulted in delays in the conduct of field activities. The project

strategically addressed these challenges through coordinating activities in collaboration with the local government and non-government entities as well as pivoting to online meetings and trainings where feasible.

On the positive side of unexpected results, the COVID-19 gave an opportunity to document the resilience of the climate smart agriculture concepts. The research pointed to complementary and diverse food production in the CSVs in combination with access to informal food outlets in the rural communities were essential parts of the local food systems that played critical roles in supplying food commodities to the population during the pandemic.

A survey to assess the impacts of restrictions brought by COVID-19 on local food systems operations showed that during the lockdown period, bottlenecks in the food supply chains exacerbated the already fragmented and poorly coordinated logistics, leading to additional transportation cost and high retail prices of food commodities. However, interestingly, in the climate smart villages, findings showed there were strong signs of resilience as demonstrated by high mean household dietary diversity scores despite significant perceived changes in the availability and prices of certain food groups. Further analysis indicated that the promotion of homestead gardens and small livestock in the CSVs buffered the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic to the households as these activities provided the households with food, enabled them to share or sell vegetables to their neighbors, and store food for extended lockdowns.

The project was funded at the early stages of IDRC's 2030 Strategy, and it was implemented with the aim of contributing to its strategic objectives.

Invest in high-quality research and innovation:

The participatory action research methods adopted by the project generated knowledge, evidence and innovations in the space of Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) through the Climate Smart Village (CSV) model. The research team identified practices, technologies, and innovations within the food system through a portfolio of socially inclusive options. This menu of options tested in a range of agro-climatic contexts of the participating communities in three countries which support household resilience, inclusiveness, and sustainable food systems were ready for adoption by local communities, NGOs, and government.

Examples from the menu of socially inclusive options that can be adapted by household in different contexts (such as those with large land areas, in homesteads, limited land areas, women-headed households etc.) include:

- technological options, such as promoting stress-tolerant varieties of primary crops,
- new platforms for agriculture production, such as integrating and improving small livestock production, and vegetable production in homesteads or in the patch of land around the household,

use of green manure to reduce the footprint of fertilizer use, improving soil health

integrating trees into the existing farming system to generate new sources of income, and

creating micro-climates around the farm to protect farms against strong winds during storms.

In addition to testing the feasibility of the identified climate smart options, the project also tested ways to motivate and promote participation by the farmers which is the key for a successful CSV model. The project approach included establishing a small community support fund that helped to provide community-level tokens as incentives for participation of men and women farmer in research activities. Even though these were modest incentives, they raised curiosity and served as motivating factors that enabled participation. Once the benefits of the climate smart methods were evident, the CSA demonstration sites attracted other farmers to join. This along with a positive cost-benefit analysis supported the project's premise that CSA practices and CSVs are viable local platforms for building resilience, women's empowerment, social inclusion, and food security.

Share knowledge for greater uptake and use:

In addition to sharing knowledge through a significant number of publications, the project organized a regional learning conference at the conclusion of the research with the objective of sharing the new knowledge and evidence generated. Participants confirmed the value of CSVs as an excellent model for promoting local resilient food systems that are also gender responsive and inclusive. Of note was the feedback by the representative from the World Food Programme (Dale Wilson, Climate Change &amp; Resilience Officer at WFP, Laos) who noted that the peer reviewed evidence that has been generated from this project was critical and extremely helpful as it allows development partners to learn and improve upon the process. The participant also stated that they would encourage WFP to implement more cost-benefit analyses and village development funds and also push for WFP to collaborate more with local partners.

Mobilize alliances for impact:

The project led by IIRR forged successful partnership with CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) which leveraged the alliance for mutual benefit through exchange of knowledge and resources. These alliances will continue the impacts of the IDRC investment beyond the project because IIRR entered into an agreement with the CGIAR initiative on Climate Resilience, also known as ClimBeR, which aims to transform the climate adaptation capacity of food and agricultural systems in low- and middle-income countries. The project team also liaised with IDRC's Myanmar Initiative and it's partner organizations and contributed to its activities. IIRR plans to continue the work initiated through this research in collaboration with national and local governments, academia, UN agencies, NGOs, and other partners beyond this project.

## Financial performance

Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

Overall, the project was implemented efficiently from the grant management perspective and the recipient demonstrated a good understanding of IDRC policies in timely submission of technical and financial reports. A 3-month no cost extension was approved to compensate for initial delays in research activities due to restrictions against COVID-19 in Cambodia, Myanmar, and the Philippines, along with the political situation in Myanmar. This additional time allowed the team to complete the research and deliver all outputs.

The extension also permitted the project to organize a Regional Learning Conference and Workshop in Philippines where research data on the uptake of CSV lessons were disseminated to the target "next users," or stakeholders who can serve as vehicles for scaling out and up for a potentially wider project reach.

# Strategic Considerations

Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

The risk mitigation strategies considered in the Project Approval Document have proactively addressed potential unintended negative outcomes of the project. Since Myanmar was listed under IDRC's Higher Risk Countries and Territories, a special approval was also granted by the Vice President, Strategy, Regions and Policy upon review of explanation that the project does not possess a security risk to staff from IIRR and local NGOs during project implementation or to visitors or POs monitoring the project.

The risk of social unrest or conflicts affecting project activities in Myanmar was also considered in detail. It was determined that although there were ongoing social tensions in some regions of Myanmar, selection of the study sites was carefully made such that all the participating CSVs were located in safer areas which remained to be the case over the length of the project. The security situation in Myanmar was also regularly monitored at IDRC by the responsible PO and the Regional Director at the ARO.

Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

There were no specific ethics related issues in the project. Data collection was on household level food security, diet diversification and livelihood outcomes in the context of climate change vulnerability. Surveys that involved personal information were carried out following necessary protocols including data security, privacy of personal information and informed consent.

As reflected in the final report, the impacts of restrictions brought by COVID-19 on local food systems operations showed that during the lockdown period, bottlenecks in the food supply chains exacerbated the already fragmented and poorly coordinated logistics, leading to additional transportation costs and high retail prices of food commodities. However, interestingly, in the climate-smart villages, findings showed vital signs of resilience as demonstrated by high mean household dietary diversity scores despite significant perceived changes in the availability and prices of certain food groups.
