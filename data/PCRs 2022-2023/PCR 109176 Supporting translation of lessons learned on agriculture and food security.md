# Project Highlights

What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

Support efforts to launch the COVID and Food System initiative and synthesize and disseminate its main results. As part of IDRC's corporate response to the COVID pandemic, the initiative aimed to address the food and nutritional security crisis associated with COVID-19, with two streams of activities. A first stream supported new, short-term activities as supplements to ten existing IDRC projects, to document the impacts of the pandemics on local food systems, and measures to control them, and the overall impacts on the food and nutritional security in sub-Saharan Africa. Activities from stream one were implemented between September 2020 and February 2021. A second stream of projects approved in September 2020, supports the development of five new projects to analyze the efficacy of responses to the pandemic with the aim of informing the ability of countries in sub-Saharan Africa to respond more efficiently to subsequent waves of the epidemic and potential future shocks. This RSP allowed to hold a launch workshop and a methodological workshop in December 2020. Then key results and lessons from the cohort of projects supported under steam were then discussed in a learning and exchange workshop in April 202221. CRES was engaged to lead this workshop. The group WrenMedia was also engaged to provide concise communication training to grantees in preparation for their participation in the workshop. A synthesis and policy briefs were produced to synthesize and share the lessons from stream 1 projects.

Support to IDRC partners' participation in AGRF 2019 and 2020. The RSP comms allowed participation of IDRC grantees and partners in three parallel events hosted by the Africa Green Revolution Forum: the CIFSRF synthesis and learning event and the First Ladies' Breakfast high table discussion in Accra, Ghana in September 2019, and the Lauch of the IDRC-Rockefeller partnership in September 2020 (online event, but hosted by Rwanda). The main outcomes were higher visibility of IDRC contribution to food security in Africa, and the gathering of a coalition of actors providing non-mainstream critical evidence for action.

Conferences to disseminate results and lessons of AFS program such as:

Learning Forum on Adaptation (ALFA) Sahel 2020, led by Care Denmark. This component allowed a series of consultations, staggered across four webinars and discussions. The original plan envisioned in-person forum in Niamey, but this was revised due to covid and security restrictions. The outputs and outcomes of the participatory discussions informed in part the CRSF GEI framework as well as the WARO Strategies, and they are linked in the outputs section.

Grant to CIRAD to sponsor specific activities at the Global Food Security (GFS) Conference 2020 in Montpellier. The conference was postponed from June to December 2020, due to covid travel restriction, and moved to a hybrid mode. IDRC had committed to financing the participation of 30 youths from low and middle-income countries to the conference. A call for proposal and selection of participants was completed in February 2020 and IDRC's contribution was announced and recognized on the web site of the Conference. IDRC's contribution allowed conference organizers to leverage additional funding to support an extra 20 youth participants, and to support translation services to French.

Mini Symposium Agropolis. This investment allowed IDRC to co-host with Agropolis Fondation and Rockefeller Foundation a donors' discussion at the GFS (see above), focusing on “Developing equitable, healthy and sustainable food systems in a changing climate: lessons from the past – directions for the future”. IDRC's participation to the GFS (to the event and financial support to the participation of youths from LMICs) was part of AFS strategy to highlight results and lessons from past work on food and nutritional security for a European audience, discuss new programming priorities on Food Systems and strengthen its relationship with CIRAD and Agropolis Fondation with whom the program has launched a collaboration (a parallel partnership worth ~2.7m CAD) on trade-offs and opportunities in supporting agroecology for sustainable transformation of food systems in francophone West Africa. A Hub working on this topic was created with new project 109805.

Strategic consultation for IDRC programming to identify priorities to address climate change, food security and gender inequality in fragile contexts in MENA: Amman consultation 003 (Marwan)

The RSP supported a regional consultation organised by IDRC which took place in Amman on March 1/2020 with the participation of 19 senior resource persons from 16 institutions based in 7 MENA countries. The objective of this consultation was to inform the development of IDRC's future programming on more resilient, healthy and equitable food systems in the MENA region, with a special attention to their linkages with fragile contexts. The identified knowledge gaps and entry points include:

The flow of climate finance to MENA is the lowest in the world. It would be strategic to make renewable energy a leverage point to access this finance. A key research question is: how to integrate renewable energy in food systems research to benefit smallholder farmers? The need for a new generation of capacity building of skills in MENA to access climate finance was stressed.

Food systems in the MENA region are transitioning and transforming very rapidly and in different directions. One of these directions is an increasing appreciation of traditional healthy foods. The research question to be raised is how smallholder farmers can enhance their integration and increase their benefits in the existing value chains of traditional foods or in the new ones to be created.

There is an opportunity for research in MENA on how to make existing large initiatives pro smallholder farmers. One example is the Green Moroccan Plan. Over the period 2010-2020, this plan doubled the export of agricultural products and of agricultural GDP and more than tripled the irrigation area with drip irrigation. However, there was no significant increase in the revenue of smallholder farmers.

The Support to the ALFA Sahel forum enabled a series of four webinars which allowed the regional community working on adaptation in the Sahel to continue cross-learning discussions even during the covid pandemics. All webinars and outputs are to be found here: Webinar Outcomes – ALFA Sahel 2020. In particular:

ALFA Sahel Webinar 1: Current and future trends and impacts for climate resilient and secure livelihoods and landscapes in the Sahel, April 2020 - This webinar explored the current and future trends that impact on climate resilient and secure livelihoods and landscapes and their implications.

ALFA Sahel Webinar 2: Natural resource governance for climate resilience and conflict management, June 2020 - Webinar 2 explored the role and requirements of natural resource governance, particularly at the local level, in strengthening resilience and reducing conflict among farmers and pastoralists in the Sahel, with two keynote presentations:

ALFA Sahel Webinar 3: Inclusive climate services approaches for resilience in the Sahel, July 2020 - The third webinar showcased three climate services, for short-term, seasonal, and long-term decision making respectively. Participants explored how these approaches integrate issues of inclusion, equality and land use dynamics to better inform decision-making and planning among farmers and pastoralists.

ALFA Sahel Webinar 4: Gender Justice and Resilience in the Sahel, October 2020- Webinar N ° 4 allowed participants to explore why gender justice is fundamental in building resilience and share their experiences of mainstreaming gender in resilience projects.

The Alfa Sahel forum should have been part of a larger in-person conference and continue beyond the cycle of the webinars. This was not possible due to the pandemic. They produced outputs in a different format, but not of lower quality.

## Project Outcomes

How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

By supporting the translation of lessons learned from Agriculture and Food Security Program, and then the climate Resilient Food system Program, the activities supported through this RSP helped to connect innovations with actors who can contribute to their adoption and implementation to achieve large-scale impact. It also contributed to strategically positioning the program in the development of the new IDRC Strategy and as a key actor in the field of Agriculture and Food Security research.

How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

Several activities were originally planned in the period when the COVID pandemic stroke, starting from March 2020. Some could be adapted to virtual means; some were postponed and others were cancelled. For example, the Conference in Buenos Aires on Food Sovereignty was cancelled by organizers. The Conference on the Status of Women and the event in Maroc were cancelled because of COVID. The Alfa Sahel Forum was cancelled in person and as a single event planned in Niamey for mid-2020, but it resumed as a series of online webinars/discussions and consultations, which allowed the partners to reach the envisioned results.

How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.

This RSP was very useful in connecting the dots between the solutions developed by AFS, then CRFS programs, and actors who can help advance those solutions to achieve large-scale impact. It was also essential to communicating strategically our results and lessons to better position the program and contribute to securing new partnership funding. As many projects and cohorts of projects didn't have these activities built in their planning and budgeting, the funds from this RSP allowed for the preparation of publications and synthesis and for holding workshops and knowledge brokering activities. With the growing expectation for POs and programs to become thought leaders, it is essential to have access to external help and resources to produce high quality outputs for external audiences. Finally, the RSP allowed initial discussions with other donors, which led to strategic collaboration and co-funding, as in the case of Agropolis Fondation.

## Financial performance

Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

This RSP was extended twice for six months, for a total of 12 months. The first extension was requested because several activities originally planned had to be postponed or cancelled due to lockdown and reduced mobility measures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. It was the case of the Global Food Security conference which had to be postponed by some 9 months due to COVID-19, to which IDRC had already committed to support and for which it was publicly recognized on the website of the event. The second extension was requested to support key synthesis and communication activities for the CRFS program. This allowed us to support the organization of the COVID and Food Systems Initiative stream 1 projects synthesis (and the Learning and Exchange Workshop), and our participation in Food Systems Summit activities.

There is a need to consider the transaction costs involved when developing and managing RSPs each time we have communication or KT needs. The fact that programs we will soon have a KT PO will certainly help us achieve our communication and knowledge translation objectives and expectations regarding thought leadership and high-quality outputs for external audiences. Corporate KT unit works through strategic priorities, and we can't count on their support for all our program KT activities.

## Strategic Considerations

Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

The risk mitigation strategies proposed the use of clear, feasible work plans to manage the time required for preparing our participation in strategic events and to manage delays in production of outputs, which worked fine. However, the COVID pandemic wasn't foreseen, and we therefore had to

--- Page 5 ---

adapt the dissemination activities to virtual means, which required a turnaround time to develop and organize them. Some of the activities were organized by other entities and were therefore out of our control, we had to adapt our timeframe to these events.

Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

## Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.
