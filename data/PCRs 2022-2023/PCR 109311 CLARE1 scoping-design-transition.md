# Project Abstract

This project supported the Climate and Resilience partnership by covering the operational costs, including salaries and benefits, office costs, and travel of IDRC staff. Separate project approval documents authorized the execution of individual research projects and activities related to program governance, communication, and evaluation.

The Climate and Resilience transition fund (or "CLARE1") is a partnership between IDRC and the UK Department for International Development. It represented a joint investment of CA$7.1 million aimed at scaling, uptake, and impact of climate research, as well as designing the next generation of research needed to accelerate adaptation and catalyze climate action in the Global South.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC·CRDI

- This phase of partnership originated in late 2018 with an invitation to IDRC to work with the Research and Evidence Division within then UK Department for International Development (DFID) to consolidate its support for climate research into one flagship programme. In 2020, DFID was merged into the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO).

- Two objectives are described in the annex to the partnership agreement (MoU) and authorization (PATH1, on file as IC01-914824797-1459):
- Scoping and design a research framework that responded to anticipated knowledge and evidence gaps needed to catalyze climate action with focus on Low &amp; Middle Income Country participation and capacity building, and;
- Scaling and uptake of science and evidence based on upon previous adaptation and resilience investments (transition from predecessor programmes).

- CLARE1 was amended on two occasions, in June 2020 as a no-cost extension during the Covid pandemic, and in July 2021 as a costed extension to support the Adaptation Research Alliance.

# HIGHLIGHTS

1. What are the most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this partnership and how have they been useful or innovative?

A jointly-designed research framework described in the CLARE Business Case and formally announced at the United Nations' climate conference (COP26) in November 2021. This framework (a) built on the results of several 'predecessors' that operated before 2020, (b) focused on research and knowledge needs following the IPCC sixth assessment cycle, and (c) sought to become more than the sum of individual research projects.

Championed a new way of working with counterparts from the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO). Previous generations of climate partnerships in 2006 and 2012 were largely implemented by IDRC with periodic engagement with a single 'Senior Responsible Officer' (SRO). In contrast, CLARE1 saw broader team-to-team engagement between IDRC and member of the Climate, Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) team within Research and Evidence Division. This included joint drafting the terms of reference for scoping papers, a joint design workshop at the Canadian High Commission in London in February 2020, and co-authoring of the Business Case submitted to UK Ministers.

Offered a transition from previous investment, allowing opportunity for further scaling and uptake (see CLARE1 reflection workshop), as well as sustaining key relationships with grantees and their stakeholders in policy and practice. Beyond the results and research outputs detailed under the separate projects (see Q2 below), CLARE1 sustained IDRC contact with a wider community that was then ready to respond to funding opportunities. The portfolio of CLARE research projects approved in early 2023 contains a mix of new proponents and previous leaders from predecessor programmes. To mention just one example, the collaboration and teamwork supported under CLARE1 project 109223, was ultimately among the successful CLARE2 projects (110007). Moreover, CLARE1 provided an opportunity to accompany research teams after the completion of their original grants, seeing how their results evolved over time.

Scoping work provided a fresh perspective on how research opportunities had evolved over the previous two decades, and needs in the decade ahead to 2030. Collectively, this scoping underscored that research must strengthen adaptation to the effects of climate change that cannot be prevented or reversed, supporting the most vulnerable worldwide. The urgency of this “age of implementation” cannot wait upon the customary linear process of research publications informing policy formulation, but rather requires more engaged models of research that are embedded in practice to foster real-time learning. This scoping coincided with the evolution of climate change under Strategy 2030 from being a single program to a crosscutting challenge underpinning IDRC’s work.

IDRC was one of the founding members of the Adaptation Research Alliance, a global coalition responding to the urgent challenges faced by vulnerable communities from climate change. The Alliance was soft launched at the Gobeshona conference in early 2021 and formally announced during the UN climate conference (COP26). IDRC convened consultations on food systems and gender &amp; inclusion. Since 2021, the Alliance grew six-fold (from 30 to 190 members) spanning research-performing, -funding, practice-, and community-based organizations committed to action-oriented research.

## RESEARCH OUTPUTS

## 2. List the most important research outputs generated.

CLARE1 contributed to IDRC efforts to learn from more than fifteen years of climate partnerships and programming experience. A list of scoping that informed the CLARE framework (see “Business Case” above) is provided at the end of this Completion Report, including works funded by CLARE1 and as well as additional works prepared across IDRC during 2019-2021. These works also helped underpin the corporate knowledge sharing efforts in 2021 and 2022. Key outputs include:

- “Designing Research to Catalyse Climate Action” an open access chapter summarizing lessons from scoping
- “Integration of gender equality and social inclusion” which identified practical recommendations throughout the project cycle

Several research outputs were generated under the transitional grants supported by the CLARE1 partnership. Full details are in the completion reports for projects 109204, 109219, 109220, 109223, 109360, 109419, 109635 and 109959. These outputs were also reported under Annual Reviews for FCDO project 300126. Among the more outstanding of these works were conceptual advances in climate risk, human mobility, adaptation by women entrepreneurs, and climate-resilient development pathways:

- Simpson et al. (2021) A framework for complex climate change risk assessment. *One Earth*. 10.1016/j.oneear.2021.03.005 – Cited in IPCC report and expands climate risk to include ‘responses’ as a fourth factor beyond hazard, exposure and vulnerability (this also inspired CLARE logo in 2023).

3. If appropriate, explain why outputs were not completed or were of poor quality.
Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

A number of the transitional grants were affected by the restrictions on mobility and gathering imposed as public health measures during the Covid pandemic. This limited the potential for scaling and uptake as opportunities to engage decision makers were curtailed during these projects. Moreover, the project teams involved in the transitional grants varied with respective in the level of detail and sophistication in their outreach plan to realize ‘research for impact’. This experience served to signal the importance of encourage and supporting project teams in elbaorating knowledge sharing (R4I) plans.

It also underscores the wisdom of project team having personnel located in country with ready access to field sites, communities, and policy audiences, without reliance on international travel. While public health measures have eased, the CLARE commitment to climate-conscious implementation encourages project design that minimizes carbon emissions and uses international travel sparingly.

## OUTCOMES

4. How does the partnership contribute to the field of study / research area?
Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

CLARE1 allowed IDRC to champion new ways of working with DFID (later FCDO) by coauthoring business case and sharing responsibilities through team-to-team collaboration. Whereas previous partnerships concentrated on the one-to-one relationship between PL to SRO, CLARE1 experimented with pairing IDRC Program Officers with FCDO Research Advisors to work together. IDRC does not submit a technical report to FCDO as an implementing agency, but rather works with FCDO to jointly prepare the Annual Review of CLARE progress (which is submitted to the FCDO Chief Scientific Advisor and subsequently released as a public document). This relationship deepened further since 2022 with FCDO SRO engaging team IDRC on program management, and with IDRC having direct access to wide network of FCDO advisors within the diplomatic posts in developing countries.

CLARE1 helped define how to replicate large-scale transdisciplinary collaboration. Refining and building upon previous work published in Global Challenges and Regional Environmental Change, IDRC expertise was sought out by the National Science Foundation and International Science Council. Based on the lessons identified during the scoping, four approaches were prioritized the 2022 CLARE call and encouraged in future research projects:

- Integrated knowledge translation – Project should be needs-driven and solutions-oriented, with research questions and results that are co-produced with potential users. Project invest in activities that improve access and use of information for vulnerable communities, that support decision-making, and methods of co-design of research and co-production of knowledge with societal actors.
- Gender equality and inclusion – Projects should clearly establish how research is likely to reduce inequalities. The 2022 call process included scrutiny of the gender, diversity and inclusion within the research team and in terms of potential beneficiaries.
- Equitable partnerships – Projects should convene a diverse coalition of actors and organizations that link research to action. Team composition ought to include shared participation and responsibility in research design, implementation, and research uptake; and ensure mutual accountability among participants for progress, outputs and outcomes.
- Capacity strengthening - Projects should recognize existing capacity and ongoing systemic barriers to the expression of that capacity, especially for individuals and institutions in climate vulnerable countries in Africa and Asia-Pacific. These considerations include both the capacity of a project team as well as that of relevant stakeholders to do and use action-oriented research and evidence.

# 5. How would you compare the intended and actual results? Why did it happen that way?

The intended result of an approved research framework and renewed partnership finally came about in early 2022 after a two-year delay. At the beginning of CLARE1, it was by no means certain the extent of involvement IDRC would have in the future research framework. Through its contributions 2019-2021, IDRC demonstrated its ability and earned a more substantial role in CLARE2 than had been initial hoped for.

While precipitated by the Covid pandemic, specific features of this delay included the creation of FCDO as a new UK Government department, a reduction in Official Development Assistance to  $0.5\%$  GNI, and an Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy. The longer than anticipated design process permitted the team across FCDO and IDRC the opportunity to improved the Business Case in response to internal review, position the future partnership as an announcement within COP26, and plan the process for the 2022 competitive call (research commissioning).

# 6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.

## FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the partnership, or IDRC's administration that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

Maintaining the fixed "split" between IDRC and donor funder is challenging. In CLARE, all allocations and expenses are split 15% IDRC and 85% UK. Yet achieving this balance requires matching funds available: both IDRC internal linked-to-donor and incoming 'revenue' from the donor. The former (IDRC funding) requires active communication with FAD, GAD, and PPB director/management and speaks to the need for Program Leaders to be on top of budgets and finance of their partnerships. The latter (donor funding) is complicated by the practical reality that FCDO has its own rounds of government Spending Reviews and budget pressures such that actual payments may vary from the milestones outlined in partnership agreements/MoU. There were multiple moments when FCDO asked if it might be possible to alter the split, allowing certain expenses to be "front loaded" or fully covered from FCDO and allowing IDRC to cover expenses in future years.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC·CRDI

IDRC practice has been to present financial reports twice per year, in July and December, covering actual expenses up to March and September respectively and forecasts for the subsequent six months. Payment requests are shown on the basis of cash flow, considering cash on hand and expenses forecast during the fiscal year. FCDO has expressed an appetite for receiving requests on the basis of accrual, forwarding funding when available given the demonstrated need to meet commitments made (and anticipate potential shortfalls in revenue during future years). Dialogue is ongoing to streamline the financial reporting under the partnership.

Under both CARIAA and CLARE1 partnerships, underspending by some projects contributed to a positive balance at the end of the partnership period. By the time IDRC identifies this surplus, there may not be sufficient time to make new allocations to fully absorb the funding. For this reason, starting with the CLARE2 agreement a clause was added to the Memorandum of Understanding to permit funding to be carried forward to a future agreement.

# STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the PAD and Partnership Authorization effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

Yes, to a large extent. The PAD describes three main risks identified in the Partnership Authorization, Part I (on file as IC01-914824797-1459):

- Risk of having a single funder for resultant programme framework - IDRC hoped to leverage the design process to increase the Centre's visibility in this space and open discussion with other funders. The first part of this risk mitigation was more successful, allowing IDRC to take stock of lessons and communicate the Centre's achievements. Despite sporadic discussions with other donors, additional pledges to CLARE have not materialized. Nonetheless IDRC reinforced its position as a thought leader connected to important teams and work in this field.

- Reputational risk of providing administrative services with thought leadership – Not only did the partnership benefit from the two staff position funded under this project, but additional in-kind allocation of staff time proved vital to being seen as equitable partners to FCDO, of particular note were the contributions by three CRFS members who not only acted as responsible officers for various projects but took on leadership for distinct parts of the framework and programme design. Having staff available to engage as equals with FCDO was a vital part of the ways of working, and range from intellectually contributions to joint reporting.

- Risk of IDRC beholden to DFID directions that are not aligned with Centre strategy – Through active dialogue, IDRC was able to communicate its evolving directions under Strategy 2030 and the Climate Resilient Food Systems. FCDO and IDRC identified common interests in substance (“on what”) and approach (“how”), including a focus on increasing the resilience of vulnerable populations and farmers in climate hotspots and support communities to take action to adapt to climate change.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

Not applicable for the operating costs of the partnership. Project level details available in separate Completion Reports.

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

The bridge funding provided for operational and capacity building investments, as indicated in this PCR, was particularly significant during a period of delays caused by external factors such as Brexit, the integration of FCDO, and the COVID pandemic. IDRC seized this opportunity not only to demonstrate its capability in managing the CLARE initiative but also to influence its design. The team's efforts during those years, made possible by the operational support of CLARE-1, played a pivotal role in solidifying the partnership with FCDO. As equal partners in the initiative's design, including the creation of the Business-Case for the UK government, the IDRC team demonstrated their invaluable contribution.

This PCR highlights the importance of investing both external and internal funds while establishing major partnerships. The CLARE-1 period also coincided with the formulation of IDRC's 2030 vision. The process of building CLARE, along with insights gained from scoping studies and other projects, significantly informed the CRFS vision and the program implementation plan of the division. It is worth recognizing and commending the "CLARE" team for their unwavering dedication, professionalism, and patience throughout the execution of this operational/capacity building project.
