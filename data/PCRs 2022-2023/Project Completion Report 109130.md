# Project Abstract

Africa is disproportionately affected by climate change with particular impacts increasingly felt in agricultural and food systems. Scientific capacity is critical to help the African continent adapt to a changing climate and transform agriculture into a vehicle for economic prosperity and social development. Support is particularly important for francophone African scientists, who face further challenges, including language barriers, the low level of research financing and partnerships, and the lack of capacity to build visibility, build networks and ensure research opportunities are equally accessible to both men and women. Among these scientists, African women face additional challenges and have often been left in the margins of agricultural research.

The One Planet Women project builds on the One Planet Fellowship, an initiative which supports emerging researchers through a career development model that combines mentoring, scientific training and networking opportunities. Consisting of a $15M initiative jointly funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and BNP Paribas, and an additional grants by the European Commission, the One Planet Fellowship aims at building a vibrant, intergenerational network of 360 African and 240 European scientists equipped to deliver gender-responsive climate adaptation solutions for African smallholder farmers. Leveraging funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and BNP Paribas, the One Planet Women project is a subset of the larger One Planet Fellowship umbrella. It aims to support the participation of an additional 30 West African francophone women scientists to the One Planet Fellowship. In addition, it offers an upgraded leadership and negotiation skills course to all women register to the One Planet Fellowship; childcare and travel subsidies for women with babies under the age of 2 whom might not be able to participate in the program due to family responsibilities; as well as access to English language courses for francophone fellows as a means to encourage greater integration of Francophone researchers into the wider pan African community of scientists and hence, contribute to reducing the gap between francophone and Anglophone Africa.

This project is implemented and managed by the African Women in Agricultural Research and Development (AWARD), the lead organisation on gender and leadership in sub-Saharan Africa, based in Nairobi Kenya.

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

This leadership project addressed the main challenges faced by francophone Africa in terms of climate change and agriculture research, such as, the low level of financing and partnerships, language barriers (available literature is often in English), lack of adequate capacity to build visibility of researchers, networks and research opportunities equally accessible to male and female scientists. Leveraging funding from an existing partnership between the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the BNP Paribas Foundation and the European Commission, the Project supported the addition of thirty (30) francophone women scientists to the One Planet Fellowship initiative. Doing so, it contributed to increase the proportion of female among agricultural scientists that are in a position to influence change and economic development in Africa.

It allowed increasing the capacities in leadership and negotiation of all the women of the One Planet Fellowship. Through interactive training on the fundamentals of leadership development, dynamics and practices in the climate change context, the participants learnt how to build strategic alliances and collaboration, show assertiveness and power to demand, negotiate and lead in challenging times. Participants also learnt how to influence climate research and innovation processes for the benefit of the most vulnerable groups including African smallholder farmers. Participants reported having gained self-confidence, awareness, and assertiveness.

The project contributed to increase women capacities in English language. This contributed to greater integration of francophone researchers into the wider pan-African research community. 49 francophone Laureate have benefitted from the English classes which, as they reported, has improved their communication with their peers and other scientists, their professional networks, and their capacities in the preparation of research proposals.

The project provided several space and opportunities for knowledge sharing and networking for the development of solutions to fight climate change in Africa. For example, during a Science Week organised in Morocco in November 2019 and a virtual Science Forum in July 2021, the participants increased their skills in scientific writing and communication, including to apply for research grants. The provided opportunities to work in smaller groups (the Group Research Projects) where they could collaborate in the writing and submission of manuscripts for peer-review papers or research proposals, transcending language, country, and disciplines barriers.

The Story telling training equipped the participants with the skills – Art of storytelling– to develop convincing narratives on their research and how it is important for climate action in Africa. A live session was organised, concluding the training, where a few Laureates delivered their stories during a cocktail ceremony in May 2022, in Nairobi, in front of an audience of partners, donors and other key stakeholders the climate change debate.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC·CRDI

The project was developed before the COVID-19 hit; therefore, a few activities couldn't be completed as planned, or at all. For example, the childcare and travel subsidies for women with babies under the age of 2 whom might not be able to participate in the program activities due to family responsibilities wasn't used, since most travels were not possible during a long part of the project.

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?
Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

This project is a contribution to efforts to address the missing links and bottlenecks in building research and leadership skills of African researchers, in particular that of women agricultural scientists. It is essential to unleash the leadership potential and build agency so that many women can take up leadership roles and influence the agriculture and related sectors and contribute to the achievement of socially equitable outcomes in climate adaptation. So far, in African Francophone countries, the tendency has been a stagnation or decline with very low female-to-male representation ratio (between 10-15 percent) in agricultural science in countries like Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cote d'Ivoire, Gabon and Niger between 2008 and 2014, due to overriding male-dominated agenda and persistent power dynamics in the science research community across Francophone Africa.

5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?
Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

The COVID-19 pandemic affected the implementation of the project and many activities had to be adapted. Results were affected too. The 30 participants to be funded by IDRC included in fact 10 Laureate candidates, 10 African Mentors for these laureates, and 10 junior African female scientists that were supposed to be selected from francophone Africa for the second phase of the mentoring process, called Learning Partners. However, these last 10 Learning Partners were not recruited. The team was slow and not very efficient to react to the global health crisis and travel restrictions emerging from the COVID-19. In spite of regular calls and encouragement by the PO to move to virtual activities, they didn't manage to overcome the complexity of aligning with the different participants' calendars and launching the related activities. They finally decided to develop other activities when the ease of the restrictions allowed to resume travel such as the Group Research Projects and the participation for two Laureates and their mentors in two major events organized by AWARD and Agropolis Fondation:

- A study tour in Europe on science-policy linkages in 2022 where they had an opportunity to discuss with representatives from the European Commission in Brussels, FAO and IFAD in Rome as well as other stakeholders.
- A science week in Montpellier in 2022 that included a Round Table with CIRAD, BNP Paribas Foundation and representatives from the French Ministry of Agriculture, a Science Café for experience sharing and peer learning, a series of scientific seminars from the Montpellier Research Pole and field visits.

With this solution, they managed to still do some activities that contributed to achieving their objectives, but they missed out on an important element of the AWARD offer, which is a tree generation mentoring program where in year one, laureates are mentored by mentors to advance on agreed goals and road map, and on year two, laureates become mentors and team up with a learning partner (early-career women) to put their new skills into practice.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC’s strategic objectives?
Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.
Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy.
Provide specific numbers where possible.

The project was totally in line with IDRC’s strategic priorities of building the capacities of leaders, as it focusses on building the technical and soft skills of African women at the intersection of climate change and agricultural sciences, so they can contribute to making a difference in agriculture policy and climate action. Leveraging on a partnership with other funders, it contributed to position the Centre as one of the key players at the nexus of climate change and food systems in sub-Saharan Africa and a key player in Francophone West Africa. It strengthened its ongoing relations with Agropolis Fondation with who we have subsequently developed a joint initiative on agroecology in the region.

The project is also in line with the center and the CRFS program strategic focus on gender and equity, in the context of the transformation of food systems so they become more climate resilient, more equitable and more healthy.

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

8. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

Award is hosted by ICRAF, a CGIAR organisation based in Nairobi Kenya, which provides both advantages and disadvantages for a funder like IDRC. On the one side, they bring the excellency and high profile of the CGs, but it comes with higher costs for salaries and less flexibility when it comes to adapting to new conditions (such as the COVID pandemic).

One of the great achievement of the project was in the incorporation of gender equality considerations into the budget. To address the potential challenges faced by women with children, who might be unable to fully participate in program activities due to family responsibilities, the project allocated resources for childcare and travel subsidies. By proactively including these provisions, the project aimed to support and enable the participation of women with young children, ensuring they could engage in the program activities without compromising their family responsibilities.

# STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

Nothing apart from the COVID-19 pandemic, which was discussed before.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

This PCR highlights, rightfully, the negative effects of climate change on global food security. It emphasizes two key ideas: Climate change disrupts traditional farming practices as shifting growing seasons and unpredictable weather conditions affect crop quality and yields. and, marginalized communities and the global south are significantly more affected by climate change-induced food insecurity due to limited access to resources and technologies. The PO stresses the need for urgent action to mitigate climate change's impact, promote adaptive farming techniques, and ensure equitable access to food resources. Projects like the One Planet Women project are an interesting tool in the fight against climate change. By extending the One Planet Fellowship approach, it empowers and equips women researchers to contribute to evidence base climate action.

As described by the PO the COVID pandemic's disruptions and the team's challenges in adapting to virtual formats impacted the project's progress and outcomes. Future initiatives and projects should emphasize stronger coordination, efficient communication, and flexibility to navigate unforeseen circumstances to ensure the successful implementation of similar initiatives.

Despite the limitations imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, one key positive component of this project was incorporation of gender equality considerations into the budget. For instance, the grantee recognized the potential challenges faced by women with children, who might be unable to fully participate in program activities due to family responsibilities. The grantee (with the support of IDRC) allocated resources for childcare and travel subsidies. By proactively including these provisions, the project aimed to support and enable the participation of women with young children, ensuring they could engage in the program activities without compromising their family responsibilities.

This inclusive approach highlights the grantee and IDRC's commitment to empowering women scientists and acknowledging their real circumstances. By providing necessary support the project aimed to create an inclusive environment that allowed all participants to contribute and benefit from the program, despite the challenges imposed by social gender roles.
