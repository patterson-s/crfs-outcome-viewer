## Project Abstract

The Research Support Project (RSP) will support participation in events, communication, and knowledge translation across the Climate-Resilient Food System (CRFS) division’s 2022–2023 priority themes. Namely, the RSP will implement key elements of the CRFS Implementation Plan to strengthen cohesion in programming and promote cross-portfolio learning.

It will do this in three ways: First, by facilitating participation in high-profile events related to climate resilience and food systems. Second, by supporting cross-learning activities, such as knowledge translation activities and learning workshops (e.g., CRFS Annual Learning Forum), to inform the development of programming and learning and the dissemination of research through publications and conference presentations. Third, by developing communication materials that showcase the results and impacts of IDRC’s investments across the CRFS portfolios.

These communication and knowledge synthesizing and sharing activities will allow the CRFS division and its grantees to participate in and help shape global debates related to climate resilience and food systems. In addition to promoting research uptake, this project will contribute to the CRFS division’s objective to develop partnerships and mobilize alliances to promote and achieve Strategy 2030.

## PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

- Held a Successful **2023 Climate-Resilient Food System (CRFS) Learning Forum**. With the support of external consultants, the tiger team worked together to design, organize, and facilitate the CRFS Learning Forum 2023, which focused on CRFS with the aim of understanding whether the work is still aligned with its previously established strategy and narrative. This three-day hybrid Learning Forum brought together all CRFS staff and approximately five grantees for a panel discussion of a few key issues:

- Is our portfolio telling the story we want to tell? Through an examination of CRFS’ strategy and narrative, the first day was about understanding the different components of the CRFS portfolio and how they could be better configured to achieve their outcome pathways.

- How aligned with and integrated into CRFS is the strategic objective private sector engagement? On the second day, concrete case studies were used to explore how researchers could better reach the private sector.

- What can we learn from our partners? On the third day, a number of donors, including four CRFS partners from Indigenous communities, spoke about Indigenous knowledge and research in CRFS’ work and beyond.

Although the Learning Forum was not entirely in person, this was a successful event and the activities helped contribute to a greater sense of community in CRFS and encouraged peer learning among colleagues. There are many lessons that can be taken from conducting such an event as a hybrid rather than an in-person or virtual event, including both strengths and challenges (see debrief report between the consultants and the tigger team and feedback from colleagues).

- Increased the accountability of food system organizations to gender equality in leadership, internal workplace policies, and implementation strategies using Global Food 50/50 processes. The project, collaboratively with UN Women, supported the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) in the development and publication of the Global Food 50/50 2022 Report: A review of the gender-and equity-related policies and practices of 51 organizations active in the global food system. This report is a public good that will be utilized by all global stakeholders and makes an important contribution to UN Food Systems Summit discussions.

- Enhanced IDRC credibility and the visibility of the Global Health (GH) and CRFS Collaborative One Health Research Initiative on Epidemics (COHRIE) through co-sponsoring the Africa Health Agenda International Conference (AHAIC) in Kigali, Rwanda, March 4–9, 2023. As part of their knowledge transfer and collaborative learning activities, three African projects from COHRIE presented at “The Collaborative One Health Research Initiative on Epidemics in Africa: Implementing intersectoral approaches to strengthen epidemic preparedness and response in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Uganda.” Over 60 people attended in person, and about 28 participants connected online. The audience expressed great interest in the projects, and side discussions between representatives and attendees continued after the presentations. This was also an opportunity for the partners to meet for parallel closed sessions, which are described in detail in this summary report.

## RESEARCH OUTPUTS

2. List up to 10 most important research outputs generated by the project. Where possible, provide the link.

Outputs are the directly achievable products of a project’s completed activities (e.g., policy briefs, journal articles, research papers, trained people, etc.). Indicate the project outputs that were published on an open access basis. What, if any, outputs resulting from this project will be published open access beyond the duration of the project, and it is possible that the grantee will seek further IDRC support for this?

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study/research area?
Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

The value of external consultants in managing the flow of hybrid 2023 CRFS Learning Forum. Having experts from Inclusive Innovation was value-added for the Learning Forum. Timing and flow are particularly important during hybrid events and that these were managed well, an aspect that was highly valued by participants. Further, Inclusive Innovation offered the combination of key interlinked activities that we were looking for in the initiative: designing/implementing the agenda, facilitating the forum, and designing and managing the virtual collaboration tools, including the customized one-stop platform. The online platform as a hub for connection, collaboration, and learning among the colleagues was deemed useful. This also allowed asynchronous engagements among colleagues before, during, and after the forum. One benefit of this was that colleagues who were not able to attend the forum were still able to take advantage of the content. Having one company handle all these activities under the same consultancy contract reduced the transaction costs, ensured continuity throughout the event, and increased efficiency on the delivery side.

## Global Food 50/50 2022 Report

Given IDRC's mandate to address gender equality and inclusion, and the goal to build southern researchers' capacity to create solutions that are gender transformative, the Global Food 50/50 report created an opportunity to influence organizations working in the food system to confront and address gender inequality within their organizations, governance structures, and programmatic approaches. The Gender &amp; Food Index presents findings on the policies and practices of 51 global food system organizations. The Index consists of 11 variables that assess performance across two interlinked dimensions of inequality: inequality of opportunity in career pathways inside organizations and inequality in who benefits from the global health system. Findings are presented below and in the Global Food 50/50 report.

## Africa Health Agenda International Conference (AHAIC)

AHAIC's 2023 focus on climate and health was well aligned with the programming priorities of GH and CRFS. Both divisions are collaborating on the COHRIE initiative, which centralizes One Health as a key approach to addressing health and food systems threats that are emerging at the human-animal-environment interface. Further, the participation of COHRIE grantees at AHAIC 2023 aligned with the CRFS and GH intermediate outcomes to amplify southern voices and leadership to enhance their influence in shaping relevant global and regional policy conversations (Trip Report, Samuel Oji Oti).

5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?
Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

- Regarding the CRFS Learning Forum, even with the help of a team of external consultants, the amount of time CRFS spent preparing was considerably higher than expected and needs to be factored into workloads for future events. Also, the consultants

were expected to coordinate with the five selected partners for the panel discussion, but this didn't happen. The coordination was mainly managed by Sandra Gagnon.

- The Global Food 50/50 2022 Report and the Africa Health Agenda International Conference were not originally planned, but they strongly aligned with the objectives of the project and IDRC's strategic objectives.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?
Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

This project intended to contribute to the IDRC Strategy 2030 objectives to strengthen knowledge translation, position research for impact, and build alliances to amplify the results of IDRC funded work.

For instance, as part of its contribution to IDRC's 2020–2030 program strategy, the CRFS program is committed to supporting Indigenous leaders and Knowledge Keepers from Latin America and Canada to learn from one another about the best tools and strategies for contributing to and influencing the orientation of their food systems. This will be accomplished through the sharing of experiences and the use and valorization of Indigenous knowledge and practices. The third day of the 2023 CRFS Learning Forum was an opportunity to invite Indigenous-led or Indigenous investigators partners to share knowledge on the critical role of Indigenous leadership in strengthening climate resilience and creating healthy and equitable food systems and how IDRC and other invited organizations can support this work. This was in line with the Government of Canada, who has positioned Indigenous climate leadership as a key priority for reconciliation, including through GAC's efforts to partner directly with Indigenous peoples on Canada's climate finance investments and ECCC's work to bolster Indigenous participation in international climate fora and ensure Indigenous voices are included directly in Canada's Nationally Determined Contribution to the UNFCCC. This event was supported by the consultants through the design and technical aspects and was deemed useful.

Another example, the funds administered through this project allowed grantees to be actively engaged in AHAIC 2023. The central theme for AHAIC 2023 was mainstreaming the climate discourse into health policy conversations, and vice versa. This theme is strongly aligned with the IDRC Strategy 2030 focus on addressing climate change, and specifically with the CRFS and GH divisions' programming choice on fostering equitable and responsive solutions for infectious diseases and for epidemic and pandemic preparedness in the context of climate change. Thus, AHAIC 2023 was seen as the appropriate platform to increase IDRC's visibility and credibility as a key research partner in Canada's international assistance efforts. The conference showcased IDRC-supported evidence and Global South knowledge. AHAIC 2023 also provided an opportunity for the grantees to deepen relationships and mobilize alliances with current and prospective partners from both private and public sectors. (Trip Report, Samuel Oji Oti).

# Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

The CRFS program, as part of the broader IDRC 2020–2030 program strategy, is committed to supporting Indigenous Knowledge as a key to transforming more sustainable and resilient Food Systems. This project aimed to facilitate mutual learning among South-North-South, shared the best tools and strategies, and influenced the orientation of food systems. During the third day of the 2023 CRFS Learning Forum, Indigenous-led or Indigenous investigator partners were invited to share insights on the pivotal role of Indigenous leadership in enhancing climate resilience and establishing healthy, equitable food systems. This aligns with the Canadian government's emphasis on Indigenous climate leadership and collaboration with Indigenous communities on climate finance investments.

As presented by the PO, the project facilitated the engagement and participation in the AHAIC 2023 conference, which aligned with IDRC's overarching focus on addressing climate change, as outlined in Strategy 2030, and positioned IDRC as a crucial research partner in Canada's international assistance efforts. The conference focused on integrating climate discourse into health policy conversations, which resonated strongly with the programming choices of the Climate-Resilient Food System (CRFS) and Global Health (GH) divisions. This alignment showcased IDRC's commitment to relevant and impactful research and highlighted the organization as a key player in addressing complex global challenges.
