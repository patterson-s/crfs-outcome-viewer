# Project Highlights

What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

## Increased incomes and employment

Research results indicate that combining multiple interventions for youth in agribusiness, such as training and mentorship, increased sales, led to better business practices, employment and entrepreneurial resilience. For example, combining training and mentorship increased monthly sales in the youth enterprises by KES 10,242 (CAD 118), implying that an intervention with 1,000 youth would generate KES 10.2 million (CAD 117,304) in sales in a county. Additionally, the same combination increased the number of employees one youth enterprise can hire by one, suggesting that an intervention involving 1000 youth would create 1,000 new jobs in a county. In the face of the Covid-19 pandemic, the combined interventions enabled quick shift in product lines or remodelling of supply chains to mitigate against the shock. For instance, Ronald Keter, a poultry entrepreneur in Kericho, was faced with competition from returning urbanites during the lockdown. He diversified his business, entered a new market niche, and started supplying his competitors with one day old chicks. His monthly profits went up to KES 10,000 (CAD 112) net after May 2020, and KES 30,000 (CAD 342) by August 2020. He also supplied traditional vegetables since returning urbanites preferred healthy diets. Thus, instead of his business declining, it grew during the pandemic. Overall, training and mentorship given to youth agripreneurs increased their appreciation of agriculture as a business and improved their productivity and profitability in agribusiness. For example, results show that business valuation was higher for the treatment group (KES 191,446, CAD 2,181) compared to the control (KES 181,903, CAD 2,072), with female participants performing twice as much as their counterparts in the control group (KES 111, CAD 1.3 versus 55, CAD 0.6).

## Enhanced capacity for agribusiness management

Capacity building interventions included training, mentorship and a combination of the two. Results show that training increased awareness and acquisition of business legal documents (11.6% treatment versus 8.9% control) while mentorship increased book keeping and accounting, and created awareness on resource mobilization. A combination of the two interventions resulted in most impact, notably, increased monthly sales and the uptake of various business practices. For example, for combined intervention, business valuation was higher for participants (KES 191,446/CAD 2,202) compared to non-participants (KES 181,903/CAD 2,091), and male agripreneurs (KES 27,529/CAD317) outperformed females (KES 15,790/CAD182) in business sales. Uptake of practices included: (i) increased record keeping from 32% to 53%, books of accounts from 20% to 41%, committing to memory decreased from 46% to 25%; (ii) increased forecasting of earnings among 69% trained compared to 50% control, females were more engaged in forecasting than males (30% vs 26%); (iii) encouraged business registration – acquisition of Kenya Revenue Authority PINs rose from 33% to 41%, county government licenses from 5% to 8%, public health certificates from 3% to 4.4%, and certificates from Kenya Bureau of Standards from 0.3% to 2.3%. Endline results indicated that 26% of the entrepreneurs were opting to legitimise their businesses as there was an increase in registration of companies, business names and county licenses.

Mainstreaming gender throughout the project cycle enhances female participation, retention and performance in agribusiness. Findings from CultiAf 1 indicated that female youth had displayed greater

--- Page 1 ---

capacity to articulate business ideas than their male counterparts. However, despite the fact that 67% of launched businesses were owned by females, some of them dropped off without completing the training cycle. This second phase of the project took deliberate measures to include female youth agripreneurs. For example, the first call for applications received a 36% female response. At at the second stage (business baseline and verification), the team mapped out a larger pool of female respondents that was able to lift the final proportion to 47%. Also, the training preference results showed that females preferred a training venue near their home; thus, the training was decentralized to counties as opposed to the original plan of a centralized location in Nairobi. Furthermore, the project provided child care for those with children and allowed others to travel with child minders for the duration of the training. The enhancement of gender mainstreaming in this project improved female performance in several agribusiness practices and resilience. For instance, the endline results showed that monthly sales for female youth in the treatment group were at KES 16,491 (CAD 189.196) compared to KES 11,785 (CAD135.206) for females in control group. Secondly, females in treatment improved with respect to record keeping. With respect to using the table banking, females were at 76.2% compared to 68.4% for males. For bank loans, females were at 61.9% compared to 67.9% for males; and for equity financing (owner provided capital), females were at 33.3% compared to 31.6% for males. This was in direct contrast to the results of the baseline which showed that females made very little use of resource mobilization strategies.

## Policy Engagement as a pathway to scale

Engaging policy makers and stakeholders is critical for project impact, scaling, and sustainability. However, it is important to define early in the project, what kinds of policy makers a project would like to engage. This project focussed on local policy makers – conties governments rather than aim at the national level. This yielded tangible results. For example, in Siaya county, county officers were an integral part of the project and its implementation contributed to their work deliverables. As a result, the county applied the concept in another youth project funded by GIZ. Similarly, in Nyandarua county, agriculture officers participated keenly in the project, and the county is replicating the model with 10,000 youth. The county has taken a first step of sponsoring an agricultural visit for youths and partnering with a leading bank to offer funding. The county has also prioritized the USIU GAME Center youth Agriprenuers for county funding and also invited GAME Center to further scale up the project in the County. Following the success at the county level, the national government through the UWEZO fund, a Kenya government fund that promotes businesses and enterprises run by women, youth, and persons with disability, has also approached the GAME Center seeking to replicate the model amongst the youth beneficiaries as a de-risking strategy in their funding program. And because of the gender mainstreaming strategies, the Association of Media Women in Kenya also seeks to use the model to conduct targeted trainings for women entrepreneurs. It is therefore imperative to identify and collaborate with the most effective policy making body that will in turn influence other key players.

## Building resilience: diversification and value addition in agribusiness

This project brought to the fore that engaging youth in agribusiness builds a strong business case for their active participation in the agricultural sector where the average age is now 60 years and increasing. Thus, while the majority of the youth tend to shun away from agriculture, those who participate in agribusiness have found it to be more rewarding and can quickly find ways to diversify their products in times of crises thereby enhancing resilience. For instance Ronald, when confronted with zero sales due to Covid-19 along with competition in his chicken business from returning urbanites,

--- Page 2 ---

aggressively reached out to his customers to buy his stock, and shifted into supplying one day chicks to his competitors. His monthly profits soared to KES 10,000 (CAD 112) net after May 2020, and KES 30,000 (CAD 342) by August 2020. He also cut his feed cost by developing his own formula and producing his own feed, he bought a lot of maize during the surplus season to make and store feed. As he anticipated the Christmas season he started rearing roosters to sell over that period. He also diversified by launching production of various types of traditional vegetables to sell to health conscious returning urbanites; produced a variety of seedlings as he foresaw emerging opportunities and applying for a government seedling program to increase bamboo seedlings from 1000, then to 10,000 and now working on 200,000. He went ahead to establish an environmental based company to handle the bamboo business value chain, and scaled up his Community Based Organization (CBO) to empower youth and women. This shows that when youth are trained and mentored, they are agile and adaptable to very fluid situations and can grow their business even in the midst of shocks and the options available help to build resilience.

Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

Three manuscripts and one teaching guide are being developed and will be completed after project closure. Also, some of the outcomes of scaling, such as the extent to which the county initiatives impact youth agribusinesses and the newly developed scaling partnerships, will become more apparent post project. First, Covid-19 containment measures put in place by the government of Kenya halted some activities that were either being completed or continuing at the point of project closure. Second, the project team had to redesign the mentorship model from the original physical to virtual and this took a long time as they had to negotiate with internet service providers for discounted rates to support both mentors and mentees. Third, the financing arrangements with the banks did not work out because the impacts of the pandemic caused the banks to shift priorities or reorganize internal processes. The project team was opportunistic enough to tap into county government financing options to be able to

deliver the project, even though the financing impact on agribusinesses would have been greater had the partnerships with the banks worked out during project implementation.

## Project Outcomes

How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

Reaping the demographic dividend requires that youth are engaged in meaningful enterprises. Agriculture provides a good pathway as it is labour intensive and can be the source of gainful employment for a large component of youth. However, it is plagued with issues that make youth shy away from engaging in agriculture. This project sought to engage youth in agribusiness and impart skills through training, mentorship and access to finance that would then lead to decent employment that offers an income and improves the livelihoods of youth.

Enhancing youth participation and investment in agribusiness: The model followed in this project was aimed at empowering the youth through knowledge transfer and providing a pathway for de-risking youth in access to finance. Working with 60 youths, phase 1 of the project found that training and business counselling significantly enhances youth participation and investment in agribusiness. This scale up phase involved engaging 1,200 youth, in 9 County Governments in Kenya to participate in a rigorous evaluation that sought to understand the impact of entrepreneurial training, mentorship and financing on youth entrepreneurship development. As a result of this project, youth appreciated agribusiness more, increased their monthly incomes through diversification and value addition, and were able to create employment for other youth (details in section 1:1&amp;5).

Improved resilience to shocks: The youth in this project were able to bounce back from the uncertainties of Covid-19 and still expand their businesses during the pandemic through diversifying into products that were most needed by the urban dwellers who migrated to the rural communities during the lockdowns. While 90% of entrepreneurs reported not being prepared for the pandemic, their customer base only reduced to 69% of their pre-Covid-19 levels. The shift to use the digital space to enable mentorship support provided timely interactions between mentors and mentees a platform to consult and get practical advice in real time to deal with the situations as they came. Relatedly, agripreneurs used the digital technologies to maintain some old customers as well as acquire new ones by marketing products online and through WhatsApp. These initiatives, coupled with diversification (section 1:5), increased the resilience of the agripreneurs and their agribusinesses.

Alternative resource mobilization strategies: The project enabled youth agripreneurs to expand their resource mobilization strategies. The capacity needs assessment conducted before the training revealed that 54% of the agripreneurs did neither well acquainted with sources of financing available on the market nor other dimensions of resource mobilization. The training module were thus modified to create knowledge on resource mobilization in general, including financing. Equipped with knowledge and skills, agripreneurs were able to mobilize resources for their businesses. Results show that several youth agripreneurs relied on non-financial assets such as land from parents, while some obtained equipment from county governments. For example, Milka Anyango Abidha in Siaya county received an in-kind irrigation system (generator, pump, tanks and pipes) and Samuel Irungu obtained access to a potato processing equipment set up by Nairobi County. A few others accessed grants e.g., Ronald

--- Page 4 ---

Keter in Kericho obtained a grant to diversify into raising bamboo seedlings for enhancing riparian lands. Thus, by emphasizing resource mobilization instead of finances, the youth are more open to take advantage of available resources rather than only focusing on money.

Female youth empowered: learning from CultiAF 1 affirmative action strategies where 90% of entrepreneurs launched their Agribusiness concepts with 60% of launches being female, enhancement of gender mainstreaming in CultiAF 2 project improved female performance in several agribusiness practices and resilience. For example, monthly sale for females in treatment were at 16,491 (CAD 189.196) compared to KES 11,785 (CAD135.206) for females in control group. Also, female youth who undertook training and mentorship improved with respect to record keeping, i.e., acquisition of KRA PINs was 28% among females in treatment versus 12% in control; having a business name was at 9% in treatment versus 6% in control; and having county government license was at 9% in treatment versus 5% in control. for equity (owner provided capital) financing, females were at 33.3% compared to 31.6% for males. This was in direct contrast to the baseline where females never used almost all resource mobilization strategies, suggesting that female mentees gained comparatively more from this intervention, and thus a more effective capacity building tool for females. Finally, females more regularly used forecasting at both baseline and midline than males, i.e., at 29.7% compared to 25.6% for males at baseline and at midline, females frequently used forecasting at 25.8% compared to 20.7% for males. On the overall therefore, purposefully mainstreaming gender by identifying their needs, applying affirmative action, and including female trainers and mentors as role models enhances female participation and performance.

How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

The Covid-19 pandemic constrained continuity of some activities such as the training of the agripreneurs and delayed the start of the mentorship and financing components. With restrictions regarding travel and public gatherings, the project team reconstructed the mentorship component to make it virtual. The team invested time in engaging internet service providers, namely Telkom Kenya and Safaricom PLC, to negotiate for discounted internet packages required to support mentors and mentees, resulting in a late start of this activity and a delayed start of the financing component that would sequentially follow. Nonetheless, the financing from commercial banks did not materialise as banks restructured their strategies and priorities in the face of pandemic. This created some difficulties for the project towards the end but given the engagement with counties, alternative funding mechanisms (where applicable) were found to move the project on albeit at a lower scale than originally planned. By project closure, some agripreneurs were only accessing the finances from the County Governments and thus the project was not able to capture the overall impact associated with the combined package of training + mentoring + financing. For similar reasons, publications will be done post project.

Provide specific numbers where possible.

Knowledge and innovation for large scale change: The project expanded the involvement of youth in training and mentorship from 60 youth agripreneurs in phase 1 to 1200 in this phase. The project also reached out to policy makers to support the financing of youth agribusiness and develop strategies whether in government or private sector that would be favourable to youth enterprises. The participating youth agripreneurs have diversified their product lines and managed to keep their businesses running even amidst the pandemic indicating increased capacity and resilience to shocks.

Building leaders for today and tomorrow: The project supported 4 students (1 PhD and 3 MBAs) whose research contributed to project outputs. It also built a platform where youth agripreneurs, who are potential leaders for tomorrow's agribusinesses, had an opportunity to acquire knowledge, expand their businesses, increase their incomes, and create employment that reaches a greater number of other youths.

## Financial performance

--- Page 6 ---

Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC’s administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

Flexibility is important especially regarding event or situations that are not anticipated a predictable. The project did get a no-cost extension which allowed completion of some delayed activities, but some were completely beyond the control of the project. For example, although a lot of time was spent negotiating and engaging banks, the financing did not happen because banks restructured their resources and priorities to manage the impacts of the pandemic. The team has suggested consideration of longer grace period after the end project ends to document more research results. For example, a typical report could be presented at the end of the project, but then funding could be made available for follow up and data collection to update the full impact on the intervention.

The project reported losing money during implementation of the project due to exchange rate volatilities. The team suggested consideration of creating a local currency account from which the grant money can be disbursed without worry of currency fluctuations.

## Strategic Considerations

Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

There was a low risk that inefficient coordination between the implementing partner (USIU) and the evaluative research partner (Busara Center for Behavioral Economics) could limit delivery of research outputs. And while there were measures taken to address this, there was no anticipation at the time that Busara would suffer serious constraints with the onset of Covid-19 that led to reduction of its staff. There was no equivalent data analyst at USIU and this caused delays until later when USIU was able to secure a data analyst to support the project. Due to this delay, outputs such as publications will be delivered post project.

Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

This project was subjected to the USIU-Africa Institutional Review Board (IRB) process certified by the National Commission for Science, Technology and Innovation, to ensure compliance with human subject’s requirements. USIU-Africa has over 24 nationally certified IRB experts and a well-established research approval process coordinated by the Institutional Review Board. Additionally, the beneficiaries of the project signed a consent form specifying that they freely joined the program for either waitlist or treatment and that their data including personal information and pictures will solely be used for this project. Also, one of the training modules was on Business Values and Ethics with the goal of orienting the youth entrepreneurs on the meaning of ethics, and how ethical practices in the global arena can increase business prospects, sustainability, and growth.

## Program Leader comments

--- Page 7 ---

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

While the urbanization of the planet is a worldwide phenomenon, the impact and opportunity on food security and youth employment have not always been thoroughly studied in the African context. The project described on this PCR is an example of the potential of agriculture and agribusiness as an agent of positive change. The integration of youth and gender equality approaches with business and market-oriented methods resulted in many new jobs and increased income for marginalized groups.

As presented by the PO, the grantees didn't produce extensive scientific literature. However, the policy briefs are exciting pieces to take into consideration. I recommend reading Gender-Sensitive Policy implications of COVID-19 on Youth Agripreneurship. It is very relevant how the grantees, supported by the vision of the PO, analyzed the context of COVID-19 negative impact. And the three policy recommendations are helpful ideas on how to build resilience in the sector. In general, the project approaches proved to be an excellent resilience tool; that went tested by the full impact of COVID.

Congratulations to the PO and co-PO for their efforts in supporting the grantees in achieving the goals of this project. The PCR makes a commendable effort to identify implementation, management, and risk mitigation lessons. At the same time, the PO acknowledges the difficulties of working with target groups that require flexibility and support.
