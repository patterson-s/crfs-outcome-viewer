# Project Highlights

What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

Three scientifically sound Heat Stress Action Plans (HSAPs) developed and implemented by the municipal corporations/council for Delhi (Delhi), Bhubaneswar (Odisha), and Rajkot (Gujarat). The HSAPs were developed and implemented by the municipal corporations, public health institutions, and meteorological departments, in close collaboration with the project, by instituting policy changes, engaging stakeholders, and supporting citizen participation, making active use of the evidence gathered. The HSAP for Bhubaneswar was formally approved and implemented by Odhisha State and embedded in the Odhisha State Disaster Management Plan. The HSAP for Rajkot was formally approved and implemented by the Rajkot Municipal Corporation and by the Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority. The HSAP for Delhi was implemented in collaboration with the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) for heat awareness campaigns, preparedness measures, and medical stakeholders' trainings. In Delhi, despite the NDMC formally convening consultations, the approval is not yet formalized (see question 3). The HSAPs are innovative and useful because they are the first evidence-based, gender-sensitive, and spatially differentiated (ward level) plans to improve the preparedness for and response to heat stress risks. Delivering early warnings about heat stress was not an established pattern in India. When the project started, not many studies had focused on understanding and quantifying the implications of heat stress and its effects on human health, work productivity, and livelihoods. Moreover, HSAPs had not been formalized yet, neither in the selected cities nor at the national level in India. The HSAPs provided a framework for the implementation,

coordination, and evaluation of extreme heat response activities to mitigate their negative impacts. The HSAPs include analysis of climatological variations, thermal hotspot mapping, vulnerability mapping, and household surveys to identify the spatial spread of heat stress and the impact of exposure to heat on mortality, health, livelihoods, and work productivity (see question 4). The evidence generated directly fed the development of the HSAPs, helping researchers and key stakeholders ascertain the temperature threshold for selected cities to declare heat stress alerts and implement targeted measures with the assistance of medical services. Examples of measures triggered by the project include:

- monitoring system (e.g., record ward-wide heat stroke cases; daily mortality and hospital admissions due to all causes and due to heat related causes; analysis of the morning temperatures recorded from hot spot sites to launch alerts)
- early warning communication (see Highlight B)
- medical trainings (see Highlight C)
- medical preparedness (e.g., installing medical camps on day of red alerts at hotspots; stocking oral rehydration salts and cool packs at the health centres as well as shock management treatments)
- tested preparedness and adaptive strategies in hot spots for pre-heat, during, and post-heat season (e.g., installing cooling shelters with water availability such as construction sites; bus stands; distribution of water, oral rehydration salts, and buttermilk; adding "Measures to prevent heat stress-related illnesses" to hospital prescription slips; distribution of gunny bags for putting on tin roofs/asbestos; planting gardens and tree canopy; white roof painting; distribution of cool roof jackets to on-duty traffic police personnel; water tanker campaigns, tankers made available on call during red alerts days)

These concrete measures will remain in place after the project is closed. The HSAPs are now being integrated into broader urban disaster risk reduction plans in additional cities in India and South Asia, helping them to make informed decisions (see Highlight D &amp; E).

Widescale early warning and awareness raised within cities using communication tools to declare heat stress alerts and disseminate knowledge on the heatwave and its consequences. This project captured the power of city-level institutions to connect with and motivate its citizens to take collective actions on heat stress adaptation by the careful use of communication tools to disseminate knowledge on heatwaves and their consequences. The HSAPs developed a communication outreach tool to share key messages on the do's and don'ts, along with raising awareness through campaigns and outreach programs that communicate risks associated with heat stress, its impact on health, livelihood, and productivity, and ways to mitigate these impacts. To raise awareness, measures have been put in place, for instance:

heat advisories were released with hoarding displays in public places

press releases and campaigns on radio, TV, and websites were used for message amplification

SMS and WHSSAPP messages for citizens, NGOs, welfare groups, construction contractors

LED screen displays, posters, and pamphlets distributed in key locations in local languages

crucial to this was the door-to-door campaigns informing citizens about the heatwave, potential impacts, and precautions

during orange and red alert days, public announcements are made through mikes across the city a day before and early on the forecasted day

Advocacy and capacity built for policymakers and key stakeholders to drive the implementation of the HSAPs. This project helped build skills and capacity in each of the cities to adapt and mainstream the heatwave planning and its management. A two-pronged approach was adopted:

First, advocacy: 1) six state-level workshops and evidence-sharing sessions with policymakers and key stakeholders intended to sensitize them to the need for HSAPs (over 500 participants attended, including representatives from municipal corporations, state departments, commissioners, public health institutes, UNDP, meteorological centres, research institutes, private companies, town planning, fire control); 2) over 20 meetings with media (e.g., for national magazine India Climate Dialogue and Odisha Television) and over 50 meetings with representatives of municipal corporations to orient them to the need for HSAPs, including meetings with ministers such as Mr. Imran Hussain, Environment and Forest Minister.

Second, specialized training and awareness workshops: 1) over 300 medical practitioners from private and public hospitals, public health professionals, and frontline health workers received training to improve the preparedness of public health systems; 2) over 10 awareness workshops were conducted to sensitize of 1000+ occupationally exposed traffic police, hawkers, street vendors, construction workers, and school children at six Urban Primary Health Centres in the three cities; and 3) over 100 stakeholders, including those experiencing high heat exposure, were trained as Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) for their community.

One medical stakeholder training module on management of heat-related illness was developed and adopted in numerous hospitals and health centres. It is a first-of-its-kind training module that aims to improve the knowledge of medical stakeholders on heat waves and the implications for human health. It seeks to enhance the enduring and efficient participation of the medical sector in addressing heat waves. This training module is designed for health care practitioners (doctors, nurses, paramedics, etc.) involved in management and decision-making processes during heat waves. This module will also equip non-medical professionals (public health department, hospital administration, volunteers) in

addressing health challenges resulting from heat waves.

The project has received important traction at the international and national levels. The project has attracted important media coverage regarding heat stress. At the international level, the project was highlighted in the New York Times and covered in a documentary by The Guardian. In India, the project was highlighted in numerous articles and over 50 interviews for magazines and television, such as in the Mongabay, Delhi Jagran, Gujarat Mirror (Gujarati), CSR network's website, Deccan Chronicle. The HSAPs were also recognized by top agencies for disaster management in India and other donors:

One permanent network was created supported by WHO and WMO—South Asia Heat Health Information Network (SAHHIN) (see Highlight E).

The Asia Pacific Network (APN Japan) is now funding the project Integrating Gender Sensitive Heat Adaptation Plans in the climate policy and guidelines of selected cities in South Asia. The project will take the scientific evidence, lessons learned, and tools generated by the IDRC-funded project to the South Asian countries of Sri Lanka (Colombo), India (Surat), and Bangladesh (Rajshahi), helping policymakers prioritize and integrate adaptive resilience and preparedness measures and develop their heat action plans.

An MoU was signed with National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA), which is an arm of Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), to develop climate-smart cities across India. IRADe and NIUA will work jointly on various aspects of climate change and cities through the Climate Smart Cities Alliance and will develop and share knowledge products, capacity building modules, advocacy, and innovative practices for mainstreaming and implementing city level climate action in India. The results and tools from the projects will directly feed into this collaboration. The first step is for IRADe to organize capacity building sessions through NIUA to support other cities in developing heat action plans.

The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Ministry of Home Affairs, which is the apex authority of the Government of India, recognized and acknowledged the HSAPs in its report Beating the Heat (see quote below on the left of the PI of the project, Rohit Magotra, Deputy Director, IRADe). NDMA revised guidelines on heat action plans for Indian states and cities in 2020 and has referred to the HSAPs and helped institutionalize project outputs integrated into government strategies on reducing urban disaster risk.

The National Research Development Corporation (NRDC), Ministry of Science and Technology, highlighted the project outputs such as the Heat Wave Advisory below and used evidence from the HSAPs in its Annual Report Expanding Heat Resilience Across India: Heat Action Plan Highlights.

One permanent network supported by WHO and WMO—South Asia Heat Health Information Network (SAHHIN)—created, ensuring continuity beyond the project period. SAHHIN was institutionalized as the regional node of Global Heat Health Information Network (GHHIN), set up by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). SAHHIN will inform and build the capacity of other South Asian countries from Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Bhutan. SAHHIN has been accredited by the WHO and the WMO. The network aims to create a common space to promote evidence-driven interventions, shared learning, co-production of information, synthesis of priorities, and capacity building. It serves as a platform to promote scientific interventions, develop action plans, and empower stakeholders with multidisciplinary strengths to tackle heat stress in South

--- Page 4 ---

Asia using better preparedness and planning measures. To date, SAHHIN has published 13 News Mailer Issues on heat stress news from South Asia and across the globe and over 20,000 people have already registered. SAHHIN has also delivered five virtual Master Classes on heat stress management, action planning, early warning systems, and heat threshold. An average of 70 people registered to each of these seminars.

If appropriate, explain why outputs were not completed or were of poor quality. Provide an explanation of why the project did not create quality outputs. It is not necessary to go through each output of the project.

Most of the key outputs are completed and good quality despite some limitations discussed below. The HSAP for Delhi was used in collaboration with the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) for heat awareness campaigns, preparedness measures, and medical stakeholder trainings. However, despite the NDMC formally convening consultations to approve the HSAPs, it is not yet formalized. However, IRADe is committed to follow up with the Government of Delhi. This may take another year for the following reasons:

In Delhi, during the Indian general elections in April–May of 2019, IRADe had very limited engagement with Delhi's city government to conduct further research and organize stakeholder consultations and workshops for the project. In Delhi, the HSAP was discussed but not prioritized by the government.

In response to the ongoing public health crisis surrounding COVID-19, consultations related to the design of the Heat Stress Index planned in March and April 2020 were postponed in Delhi. IRADe were also set to launch the first version of the HSAP in Delhi, but it was not adopted due to COVID-19.

The team recognizes the importance of considering the gender implications of the proposed mitigation strategies. However, gender issues have not been fully considered in the HSAPs. The overall recommendations of tested and implemented preparedness and adaptative measures in the HSAPs are not taking the different needs of women and men into consideration. A gender analysis was

--- Page 8 ---

planned regarding proposed measures and gender differentiated need, but it did not happen because of the lack of gender expertise embedded in the core team from the very start. However, a gender expert was added to the research and used gender analysis tools to understand, develop, and proactively generate evidence on gender-differentiated impacts of heat stress and coping strategies. One report was produced, but the results are not integrated into the HSAPs. However, the new project funded by the Asia Pacific Network (APN Japan) Integrating Gender Sensitive Heat Adaptation Plans in the climate policy and guidelines of selected cities in South Asia will use the evidence and tools from the IDRC-funded project, making the gender aspects central to the development of the plans in the select cities in South Asia.

The team recognizes that a larger research sample size would have further amplified the project evidence for policymaking at the national level. The evidence-based projects related to climate impacts should have a larger sample, in sync with the accepted sampling for IPCC.

Another limitation, which was discussed extensively during several conference presentations, was the calculation of the impact of high temperatures on mortality. There is a well-established relationship between high ambient temperature and risk of death. However, it is challenging to ascertain the number of deaths attributable to heat each year. There are few estimates of the number of heat deaths each year in India. One challenge is that heat wave timelines, mortality data, and hospital admission data related to mortality are usually not well maintained at the city level. The researchers applied well-established regression methods to estimate the number of excess deaths attributable to heat in select cities. Using these methods, they found that the annual death toll attributable to heat was larger than previous estimates produced by searching death records for cases coded as being due to heat. However, several limitations were discussed. They did not have information on deaths resulting from external causes from urban dwellers, potentially leading to an underestimate of the burden of heat on health. The team mitigated this challenge by collecting and comparing data from numerous sources.

These limitations were compensated for by the team's impressive reach into the relevant government sectors in selected cities and by IRADe position as a reputed public policy think tank primarily focused on practitioners and decision makers.

## Project Outcomes

How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area? Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

It was important to fund this project because heat stress-related deaths in India are rising rapidly, particularly in cities. There is little understanding or quantification of how heat stress affects the health, work productivity, and livelihoods of economically and socially marginalized populations. Data was gathered to develop evidence-based, gender-sensitive, and spatially differentiated HSAPs and support their planning and execution in three cities: Delhi, Bhubaneswar, and Rajkot. The HSAPs are based on quantitative and qualitative measures, primary and secondary data, existing adaptation plans, and shared learning dialogues with stakeholders.

The key findings are:

Innovative methodology developed combining thermal hotspot mapping and vulnerability mapping

--- Page 9 ---

To identify Urban Heat Islands (UHI) and the impact of heat stress on the mortality, health, work productivity, and livelihoods of vulnerable populations, the researchers developed a unique methodology combining thermal hotspot mapping and vulnerability mapping:

## Thermal hotspots spatial mapping combines

1) the use of Landsat images for the spatial mapping of hotspots within the cities' delineated wards of slums and scattered settlements with temperatures above 40°C; 2) analysis of climatological variations in summer months using the parameters Maximum Temperature (Tmax), Minimum Temperature (Tmin), and Relative Humidity (RH) to identify the spatial spread of heat stress. Land Surface Temperature (LST) maps and the ambient air temperature were also used to develop thermal hotspot maps for the three cities. Hotspots are areas within a city that experience ambient land surface temperature in excess of the LST values of surrounding non-urban areas. About 10 such hotspots were identified in each city.

The thermal hotspot maps have allowed for the design of targeted interventions during heat waves to ensure preparedness for heat risks (such as distributing water to strategic areas and using white reflective paint on roofs to reduce the heat in homes by as much as 5 °C). In addition, these maps allowed for the identification of heat islands and an analysis of past years' data. Examinations of mortality, temperature, and humidity data for specific timeframes confirmed the statistical relationships between the parameters. This helped ascertain the temperature threshold at which selected cities should declare heat stress alerts. Furthermore, a comparative study of thermal hotspot maps for each season helped identify the months in which precautions need to be taken, and an impact analysis examined the impact of extreme heat events on the health, livelihoods, and work productivity of the vulnerable population in the selected areas. Indicators such as geographic location (ward level), socio-economic strata, residence, and work were used in delineating hotspots and identifying areas with lesser means to adapt to heat stress.

## Vulnerability mapping combines

1) identification of vulnerable areas (slums and scattered settlements, minimal access to water and sanitation, and minimal presence of household amenities); 2) identification of populations vulnerable to heat (slum dwellers, women, children, elderly, working population such as auto rickshaw drivers, factory workers, sweepers, labourers, shopkeepers, street vendors, construction workers, drivers, traffic police); 3) identification of wards by overlapping hotspot criteria and the location of vulnerable populations. Then, multilevel stratified sampling was used to select around 250–300 households (HHs) within the hotspots and questionnaires/research tools were used to capture how these HH members perceived the impact of heat stress on health, livelihood, and productivity. In addition, structured interviews were carried out through door-to-door surveys at the HH level using the comprehensive index, comprising 9 sectors and 26 subsectors—sanitation, water, electricity, health, transportation, housing, cooking, awareness, and heat symptoms.

## Evidence on rising heatwaves and increasing temperatures in the project cities on a spatial and temporal scale.

The climatological analysis indicated an increase in heatwaves and increasing temperatures over the years with an increase in both the number of dry days and the frequency of heatwaves. For examples, in the three cities hot days now begin as early as March in terms of maximum as well as minimum

--- Page 10 ---

temperature, resulting in an increased number of hot days and an expansion of hot months. In Bhubaneswar, an increase in minimum temperature along with evening humidity makes it difficult for urban areas to cool down in the evening, causing heat-related discomforts. In Rajkot, a significant increase in the city's temperature and a moderate decline in its humidity levels indicates that the city is getting drier and hotter over time. For 16 of the 17 years between 2001–2017, the Tmax for each of the summer months was above the climatological mean. In Delhi, considering RH across the whole season, both morning and evening humidity values recorded higher values compared to the climatological mean value consistently through 2013–2017.

The research also confirmed that there are intra-city variations in the temperature and relative humidity. For example, based on the recommendations of the project, heat stress thresholds used for early warning systems for the city of Rajkot were reduced. The project has also captured the intra-city temperature variance as per land use at the ward level in order to undertake targeted measures. These variations were found to be pronounced in geographically disadvantaged areas like slums, which are usually characterized by deficient services, especially shortages of water and electricity during summer months and inadequate housing.

Evidence on impact of extreme heat on health, work productivity, and livelihoods of vulnerable population highly exposed.

Researchers carried out a comprehensive analysis of heat stress on the health, work productivity, and livelihoods of vulnerable populations, such as occupational workers, women, children, and senior citizens, from identified hot spots areas, and those whose indoor living conditions aggravate their vulnerabilities to heat stress.

The analysis shows that the shortage of infrastructure services such as water and electricity, especially during the peak summer months, inappropriate housing structure, weak economic capacity to access health care, and lack of awareness to manage heat stress are the key issues aggravating the impact of heat stress on vulnerable populations. The surveyed area lacked basic amenities like public toilets and water tanks with clean drinking water. Most people were working without proper shelter or were setting up their shops under trees to have shelter. The research also established evidence on the correlation between heat stress and health risk. The public health centres are far away and visiting the facility means losing workdays. It is also established that in the project cities, people working in the informal sectors lose more than 25% of workdays in a year to heat stress. People working indoors, especially women, are more prone to heat stress than those who work outdoors in the informal sectors due to factors of housing structure, availability of services, etc. Women who have the additional responsibility of caregiving in the house are also further vulnerable to heat stress. Some examples of findings are:

- Wage Loss among vulnerable groups
- Delhi holds the record for the highest wage loss as a result of heat at 36%, followed by
- Bhubaneswar, then Rajkot. The average monthly wage loss was INR 600.
- Gender-wise, wage loss records indicate that male workers in Delhi experienced the highest wage loss (90%), followed by Rajkot (76%), and Bhubaneswar (76%).
- Casual workers are the most affected; their wage loss is highest as compared to the other

--- Page 11 ---

occupations because their work requires them to be exposed to direct heat. Casual workers in Rajkot incurred the highest loss among all the cities.

## Productivity Loss among the vulnerable groups

Productivity loss can range anywhere between 1–5 days and 15 days, based on the intensity of heat stress. Delhi recorded the highest loss in productivity (36%). The cities of Rajkot and Bhubaneswar recorded over 25% productivity loss during periods of heat stress.

The male working population recorded the highest productivity loss in Delhi (1–3 hrs).

Bhubaneswar male and female populations recorded nearly a complete day of productivity loss. Like the wage loss, the productivity loss among casual workers is also high (30%), with Rajkot recording the highest losses (33%).

## Evidence of mitigation measures used by urban dwellers during heat period

In Delhi, people opted for green roofing, installing damp covers over the windows as curtains to mitigate heat inside the house, hand fans, and staying close to windows/doors when inside the house. At workplaces, respondents preferred comfortable clothing, using hand fans, and drinking plenty of water.

In Bhubaneshwar, methods like covering roofs with vegetation, using window blinds, watering walls and floors, consuming plenty of fluids, and wearing comfortable, light-coloured clothing were preferred. At work, using hand fans and wet clothes were preferred. They preferred newspaper and radio for any heat stress communications.

In Rajkot, people preferred sleeping on the floor, using curtains, and cooling themselves by pouring water on their floors.

## Evidence on the impact of heat stress on informal sector women workers

A total of 126 informal sector women workers were surveyed across the project cities (hawkers/vendors, maids/sweepers, daily wage workers, construction workers/helpers). The study sheds light on the effects of occupational heat stress on women and on their living conditions. The study indicated that during peak summer months most of the women face sleep problems. The second most common problem was the unavailability of clean, potable water. Most of the women reported that they spend between INR 1–500 for the treatment of heat-related illness. A few of the maids/sweepers (11%) reported that they must bear the high cost of treatment (between INR 1501–2000) when they fall ill due to heat-related illness. The presence of comorbidities and direct exposure to the sun makes the symptoms of these illnesses worse, but they have little choice. Their work requires them to work outdoors regardless of the weather.

How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way? Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

A 12-month, no-cost extension was approved, enabling the consortium to pursue activities to assist in the response to the COVID-19 crisis in India. In collaboration with National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC), and Odisha State Disaster Management Authority (OSDMA), IRADe carried out the studies required to assess the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 and Action Plans for managing the impacts of COVID following the HSAPs approach and

--- Page 12 ---

framework. The extension enabled IRADe to prepare more robust and longer-term responses to the pandemic, as well as to showcase the value of the HSAPs as a means to respond to policy demand. In the context of the actual confinement measures and the incoming heat season, the HSAPs are enabling governments to uphold their commitment to improve the preparedness of hospitals/health centres. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in India, the team has made a significant contribution to the dissemination of policy approaches to tackle COVID-19. See the list of outputs related to COVID-19 below:

Policy brief: Strengthening Public Health Systems for COVID 19 Response. This highlighted the need for strengthening the public health system to deal with emerging health challenges like COVID-19 and recommended several policy changes in the health care system and the COVID-19 containment strategy. The brief also provided policy action pointers for better preparedness for future public health challenges.

Policy brief : Role of GIS in COVID 19. This highlights the application of GIS for COVID-19 incidence mapping at the ward level in Delhi. The researchers mapped the COVID-19 incidences reported in Delhi, April 8–14, 2020. Through mapping, it was identified that there were 47 COVID-19 hotspots distributed in 37 wards of Delhi. This analysis shows that containment measures should be more strictly implemented in these 37 wards distributed in nine infected districts. Combining socio-economic data from the infected wards allows estimates of other potential populations under risk. Such an analysis is also the starting point for modelling the future spread of the disease.

Article: Gendered response for tackling COVID 19 and its aftermath. The manifold impacts on gender calls for a gendered approach to COVID-19 responses. Here it is important to highlight that aggregated data being managed currently is producing only gender-neutral policies to deal with COVID-19. To enable a gender sensitive response, some steps should immediately shape a more equitable landscape. To start, it is important to develop disaggregated data that includes gender along with age and disability to ensure that policymaking takes this data into account when putting in place a policy prescription. To achieve this, engagement with existing women's networks to obtain their support could support connectivity and secure vital actionable information. Measures to be taken for pandemic management should be based on a strong gender analysis, considering gendered roles, responsibilities, and dynamics. The policymakers need to design gender sensitive action plans for relief, response, and rehabilitation from this public heath disaster.

Article: Policy approach and actions to manage and improve COVID response. A pandemic like COVID-19 requires relief management and rehabilitation even before the infection peaks. It is of the utmost importance for civil society and citizen engagement to spread awareness and provide access to real time information and knowledge to enable people and organizations to take appropriate action. Civil society has been a major contributor to the response to national disasters such as heat stress, but in the case of COVID-19, civil society's potential has been under-utilized. The government must make use of the experienced and skilled response force available in its civil society.

Webinar convened: National Academy Science, India: Kerala Chapter - Jagrukta Abhiyan for COVID 19 Pandemic. IRADe contributed to the scientific community's efforts to enhance resilience and preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic. Experiences and possible strategies to build resilience were shared.

How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives? Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.

Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy.

Provide specific numbers where possible.

The project contributed to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan and the climate change program's outcomes related to building long-term resilience in communities affected by climate change.

The project was consistent with CCP's program objectives and was directly related to CCP's priority research themes, concentrating on cities and on climate change, and introducing research on health and climate change, a new theme for the CCP. The project did "connect solutions with actors who can help advance those solutions" (p. 5) to increase resilience at the city level. Specifically, the project conducted policy-relevant action research and established strong collaborations with national and city authorities and affected communities to inform and support the institutionalization of HSAPs and to bring DRR and adaptation solutions to key stakeholders working on improving resiliency and sustainability in India's urban areas.

The project aimed to "generate knowledge for large-scale positive change" that had an impact by influencing city, state, and national urban planning practices and policies in Delhi, Bhubaneshwar, Rajkot, and beyond. The HSAPs support India's short, medium, and long-term development planning, especially in prioritizing and integrating adaptive resilience within the agenda of Climate-Resilient Smart Cities. Knowledge, trainings, and preparedness, as well as adaptative measures, were effectively included in the implementation of HSAPs, potentially benefiting millions of people. Moreover, funded by Japan (see Question 1: Highlight D), the supported HSAPs will contribute to formulating plans for other cities in India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka facing similar vulnerabilities. Finally top disaster agencies in India are actively using the methodologies, capacity building tools, and knowledge generated by the project (see Question 1: Highlight D &amp; E).

# Financial performance

Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

IRAD e managed the funds very professionally. Despite this, a 1-year extension was necessary for this project.

First, it took 12 months for the project to receive country clearance, which had an impact on the original timeline. The project received country clearance in September 2017 and the project grants were received in November 2017. Consequently, given the seasonal nature of the project, data collection, and other activities related to field research, the project could only begin in the summer of 2018 (March–June). This delay impacted activities that were dependent on the first round of data collection. The delay of project activities in the first year also led to underspending compared to the budgeted expenses.

Second, the first wave of COVID-19 greatly affected the whole team at IRAD e and the implementation of the preparedness and adaptative measures, and a plan for a budget re-allocation was designed to

accommodate the change in project implementation scenarios during the last year of the project.

## Strategic Considerations

Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

The risks highlighted in the PAD were managed appropriately by the team. Aside from the 12 month wait for the country clearance and COVID-19 discussed above, the other unanticipated risks that emerged were:

Given the success of the project research outputs and acceptance by the city/state agencies, they expected more support in implementing action plans. This was not planned. IRADe planned these initiatives with the city municipal corporations and the disaster management agencies.

IRADe had planned to work with the National Resources Defence Counsel (NRDC) during the proposal stage to communicate the lessons learnt from the project and further dissemination, however due to FCRA regulations, they were not able to work with the agency for regional and international dissemination.

The inclusion of local legislators, parliamentarians, and top bureaucrats helped to prioritize policy support and action. The project was quite successful in leveraging the same; however, IRADe greatly underestimated the time that should have been assigned to this process.

On a final note, South Asia is not an easy region to work in and projects with a strong advocacy component that includes engagement with the government system (e.g., for project clearance, transfer of funds, policy dialogue) can experience numerous challenges, particularly in terms of timeline. Furthermore, given the seasonal nature of the project and strong IRADe engagement with local government bodies, many of their activities were dependent on them, consequently it has been challenging for them to complete the project in the designated time. Given the above, a one-year project extension request was made and well justified. Finally, the strong support from Anindya Chatterjee, who has always agreed to represent IDRC in different events in Delhi, has been crucial for the smooth and successful implementation of this project and for getting the policy traction and acknowledgement that the project team needed.

Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

All institutions in this project had their own ethics guidelines and procedures that researchers adhered to; these were compared during the inception phase to ensure there were no contradictions. IRADe followed rigorous research quality and publication guidelines. However, IRADe highlighted that they could have engaged better by organizing partner orientations specifically around branding and marketing the project outputs and deliverables. They noted the importance of establishing guidelines early in the partnership. IRADe and IDRC found that this was sometimes ignored and that diligent planning processes for approval of outputs, including branding and marketing, could have been done sooner in the project.

# Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

During the three years of implementing the Heat Stress Climate Adaptive Action Plans Project, the grantees and their research were able to influence and inform policies at the municipal level that will benefit thousands of people. As presented in this highly detailed PCR, the project had an extraordinary impact on municipalities: in their systems and process, their training and capacity building tools, their communication approaches, and overall, the scale of their early warning systems. The grantees developed balanced research, training, policy influencing, and advocacy portfolio.

Beyond the municipal scope of the project, the team has contributed to an extensive production of scientific and mass media publications, both at the regional and global levels. The Support of the PO to grantees and her contributions to supporting the project's success is an example of IDRC's Grants-Plus model.
