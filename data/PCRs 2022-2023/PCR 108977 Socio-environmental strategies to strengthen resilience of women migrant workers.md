# Project Abstract

This research project assesses the level of impact of climate change on local reality faced by thousands of women migrant workers in the lower territories of the Reconquista River Basin, north-west of Buenos Aires, Argentina. More than 4 million people live in the Basin, one of the most polluted areas in the country. It is home to many migrants from northern Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay and the largest Argentina's open-air dump. The research, led by the Buenos Aires-based Universidad Nacional de General San Martin, analyze the extent to which climate change determines women's migration to the Reconquista area and also examines how social factors such as class, ethnicity, and gender interact with socio-environmental and climate-based realities to determine the capacity of migrant women to fully exercise their control over resources and decision-making.

Based on the evidence obtained, a training course strengthened women's resilience and capacities to deal with climate change challenges by granting them a diploma as socio-environmental change agents and guardians of their own rights. This was meant to guarantee the sustainability of their lives against daily conditions of inequality and violence. Through an approach fully recognizes their rights and abilities, migrant women were helped to change their living conditions and become relevant, resilient actors against the pressures of climate change. The findings are planned to be replicated in other contexts through training workshops and dissemination activities involving community leaders and technicians from other Reconquista municipalities.

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

This report refers to Project #108977: Socio-environmental strategies to strengthen resilience of women migrant workers in the Reconquista River Basin, Buenos Aires, Argentina, abbreviated as MIGRANTAS. This research is one of seven projects of the former Climate Change program initiative, "Accelerating Climate Action: Social Equity and Empowerment of Women and Girls", launched on March 8, 2018. This one, was an intensive local research action project with strong roots in the territory, stemming from the rich experience accumulated by the Universidad Nacional de San Martin (UNSAM) working in the outskirts of Greater Buenos Aires; and the commitment of a young group of researchers with a strong feminist background but little or no background on environmental and climate change issues.

This project succeeded in assessing and understanding the relationship between gender, migration, and climate change by building a multidisciplinary team and involving a wide range of UNSAM researchers' groups, who had never worked together before. Its interdisciplinary research approach involved five academic units: i. Institute of Architecture; ii. Institute of Environmental Engineering; iii. School of Politics and Government; iv. School of Humanities; v. Territorial Articulation Program. This approach strengthened academic and institutional ties between teams, researchers, students, and stakeholders, and promoted collaborative forms of research and transformative engagements in academia. On the one hand, it produced a water purifier filter to improve the quality of life of migrant communities and on the other, became a reference point among UNSAM researchers, students and teachers in terms of internationalization of knowledge, interdisciplinary collaboration, and strong anchoring in the territory.

MIGRANTAS had a direct impact on state policies at the local, municipal, and provincial levels. It succeeded in positioning the project as a bridge between the territory's problems and the municipal and provincial government levels. As an example, it succeeded in creating spaces to help migrants access the Argentinian Platform for Granting of Residences to Foreigners (RADEX), public primary and secondary education (FinES); as well as receive monetary transfers through the Emergency Family Income program (IFE). The work carried out by MIGRANTAS fosters collaborations between UNSAM and the State, as applied with the National Institute of Associativism and Social Economy (INAES) for the formalization of productive initiatives on textile and care work led by migrant groups, organized in five cooperatives. At the provincial level, the socio-environmental impact mapping study was led by UNSAM's Institute for Environmental Research and Engineering. It served as the basis for carrying out the piping of the Eva Perón stream, developed by the Provincial Organization for Social and Urban Integration (OPISU) in collaboration with the provincial council of the Reconquista River Basin (COMIREC). The active role deployed by the project, collecting information through migrants' mobile phones during the COVID 19 pandemic lockdown and afterwards enabled active collaborations with the Argentinian

National Ministry of Science and Technology (MINCyT) through participation in three surveys on the effects of the pandemic, providing in situ data from the Reconquista Area. In consequence, the MINCyT was able to assess the pandemic's impact on popular neighborhoods and inform public policies through scientific evidence. MINCyT also provided additional funds to MIGRANTAS to collect detailed information on the pandemic's impact.

This study found that collaboration stemming from the active role of migrants' networks succeeded in filling the gap left by the state. This research shows that the agency and capacity of migrant women to deploy multiple community care strategies based on collective organization and networking have increased their chances of transforming intersectional inequalities in the most vulnerable neighborhoods, mitigating the effects of the health crisis resulting from the pandemic.

The Diploma in Gender Environment and Territory developed by MIGRANTAS trained 36 women migrants through 120 hours of in-person courses conducted from April to July 2022. The diploma, certified by the UNSAM Academic Council, tackled practical concepts of the environmental and gender agenda reflected in the Reconquista territory and in their lives. It aimed to provide tools to turn them into agents of change in the territory, enabling them to successfully develop their own projects. It strengthened skills and provided techniques for the implementation and management of the socially productive projects mentioned above: assertive communication, public speaking, written expression, negotiation methods and network management. Most of the women are currently leading the six productive projects and active migrant networks deployed over the Reconquista River area. Thanks to the diploma, the migrant communities produced artistic tools presented at migrant festivities and films and through communication material circulated through Youtube and social networks. The diploma was incorporated into the regular courses conducted by UNSAM and represents an indicator of the impact and magnitude of the project in the territory.

MIGRANTAS produced a conceptual, practical platform for the discussion and elaboration of the municipal ordinance, entitled "Democratic Management of the Caring City". This ordinance incorporates the gender perspective as a guiding principle of policies covering habitat, housing, and city rights. The scientific evidence shows the link between environment, territory and gender, incorporated and implemented by the Municipality of General San Martín in accordance with Argentinian Federal Law 14,449 on Fair Access to Habitat". Thus, in January 2021, the Municipality established the Municipal Institute for the Development of Habitat and Housing. This Institute is in charge of putting the ordinance into place, making it viable, and continuing to promote areas of participation among all actors in the territory.

# PROJECT OUTCOMES

## 4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

At scientific level, this project succeeded in demonstrating that women's unpaid care worker roles can be extended to environmental and nature care work. Although the careworker role of migrant women is widely recognized in the literature, this research has filled a vital gap: not in terms of overloading women with yet more tasks but expanding their agency and ability to act in the territory. Migrant women make use of knowledge and experience drawn from their rural lives, as it relates to land and water care, and their territorial socio-community skills too. The identification of migrant women environmental care workers also allows us to make visible knowledge about how the many global dimensions of climate change can be perceived locally. At institutional level, this project succeeded in building a knowledge platform for the preparation of a Municipal Ordinance for the Democratic Management of the Caring City in San Martin, strengthening the role of the University in the territory. At academic level, the project successfully trained 36 migrants through a diploma on gender, territory and environment; and supported four undergraduate students, one master's and one PhD. Finally, the project also played a key role in the COVID pandemic: helping communities and supporting local and provincial government actions. The outcomes and outputs exceeded the expected results of this CAD 536,000 investment.

## How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

The sudden emergence of COVID at the beginning of the second year modified the original work plan and resulted in additional objectives: such as developing new methodological approaches in the field (hybrid or virtual modalities), while recognizing population demands. Participatory actions and policies were redirected and readapted in the context of the outbreak. Government measures proposed at that time were not adequate to the migrant population target audience, which was comprised from more vulnerable social groups. This owed not only to the socioeconomic, infrastructural and socio-environmental conditions in which they are framed, but also to the situation of migratory regularization: which made it difficult for them to access emergency public policies targeted at the most impoverished sectors. Readjusting the project thus served to highlight the particular forms which socio-sanitary emergency policies had acquired in San Martin, and to strengthen the networks in which they had been working.

The project also exceeded expectations on the participation, dissemination and involvement achieved with local migrant communities. The organization of artistic activities involving these communities has also been a major project landmark.

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

7. Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

Recurrent technical challenges were posed to UNSAM financial department technicians in fulfilling IDRC's financial requirements. I would suggest conducting three hours' training for recipients without previous experience of working with IDRC. The Argentinian currency was also a recurrent issue for GAD colleagues, which affected the project throughout its life; in particular, its closure.

# STRATEGIC CONSIDERATION

8. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

Although the COVID pandemic has changed the terms of these, the project has performed in accordance with previously agreed risk mitigation strategies.

9. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

academic community, to the municipal and provincial state actors and to the migrant communities themselves. The project highlighted migrant women's role as change agents in the stewardship of the natural environment and leaders of climate change adaptation. Through an intersectional approach (such as looking at women as mothers, migrants, LGBTQ), the research highlights migrant women's agency, capacity and the possibility of contributing to their better access to rights, resources and decision-making. The project had a direct impact on state policies at the municipal and provincial levels. It created a platform for the elaboration of a municipal ordinance, incorporating a gender perspective as a guiding principle of policies covering housing, habitat and city rights. The research helped to determine the piping of the Eva Peron stream and also developed a water purifying filter to improve the health of migrants. The data collected directly from migrants also assisted the provincial and municipal governments to understand the real-time impact of the COVID pandemic on this population. Ultimately, this project shows the power of women-led migrant networks in advocating for the needs of their communities in times of crisis.

The project will have a lasting impact on the region, given that the diploma that was developed, Gender Environment and Territory, which provides tools to turn migrant women into agents of change, enabling them to advocate for their needs and to share their knowledge on environmental stewardship, will continue being offered to more people in the Reconquista territory. The journal articles written through this project should be widely shared amongst SIE, DIG and CRFS staff to deepen their understanding of the results of this very successful research project.
