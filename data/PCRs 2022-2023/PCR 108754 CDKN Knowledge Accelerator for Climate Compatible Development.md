# Project Highlights

What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

The infographic below provides a snapshot of the impacts of CDKN, and more highlights of impact can be found in CDKN's publication entitled Weaving Knowledge and Action on Climate Change, available here.

Below are five examples of impact. There are 21 other stories of impact across Africa, South Asia and Latin America available upon request.

Using Wikipedia to enhance global knowledge on climate change

# CDKN's Achievement

CDKN's Knowledge Accelerator enhanced the quality and accessibility of information related to climate change on the world's largest online encyclopaedia, Wikipedia. In particular, CDKN focused on improving the appropriateness of climate information related to the global South and amplified Southern voices on the platform. CDKN increased awareness amongst climate change researchers and practitioners of the value of contributing to the platform, and enhanced their confidence and skills to edit Wikipedia. A total of 90 new editors from the global South were trained to edit Wikipedia, and 320 articles were improved, which have since gained over 20 million views.

# How CDKN achieved this impact

In collaboration with Future Climate for Africa and the Wikimedia Foundation, CDKN hosted two edit-a-thons in 2019 (in-person) and 2020 (virtual), conducted a webinar to raise awareness about Wikipedia, and compiled a guide. How to contribute climate change information to Wikipedia: A guide for researchers, practitioners and communicators (available at www.cdkn.org/wikipedia). The guide was later translated into Spanish, and a Latin American edit-a-thon was held in 2021.

Participants at the first Wikipedia edit-a-thon on climate change in Africa, which brought together 30 African researchers from 10 countries across East, West and southern Africa.

Africa's first edit-a-thon on climate change in August 2019 aimed to tackle what has been called the 'Africa gap' on Wikipedia, ensuring that evidence from African researchers features strongly on the platform. Wiki4Climate: A week of editing climate change topics on Wikipedia was held virtually over seven days in November 2020 and focused more widely on climate change practitioners in the global South.

The proportion of women editors subsequently participating in the Wikimedia Foundation's Wiki4Climate event - a fully worldwide climate edit-a-thon - was approximately 51% (much higher than the proportion of women editors on Wikipedia itself, which is only around 20%). And the proportion of editors from the global South was even higher, at 72% (compared with around 20% for Wikipedia itself).

Partnering with Wikimedia South Africa and the Wikimedia Foundation helped ensure that CDKN's initiative was embedded within the broader Wikipedia movement and its goals. An important outcome of the Africa event was the creation of the Wiki Project Climate Change Africa Task Force, which participants signed up to so as to further help the development of Africa related climate change content on Wikipedia.

The Wikipedia work showed CDKN the value and opportunity of looking at improving the global knowledge commons alongside CDKN's more usual demand-driven initiatives at country level.

Making global science more relevant for regional decision-makers and communicators

## CDKN's achievement

There is a significant need to produce accessible, relevant and tailored key messages from the latest global scientific assessments for regional policy-making and media audiences. In the Knowledge Accelerator, CDKN synthesised thousands of pages of material from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to contextualise and interpret this information for regional actors in Africa, Asia and Latin America. CDKN also collaborated with African authors of the Africa chapter for the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Working Group (WG) II report on Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability to Climate Change. CDKN provided science communications support to the IPCC WGII Technical Support Unit (TSU) to refine and share messages from AR6 for African audiences. From March to June 2022, CDKN's tailored IPCC AR6 factsheets (see outputs in the section below) were viewed over 1,000 times, downloaded 450 times collectively and shared extensively on social media and in webinars. CDKN's land and the ocean and cryosphere reports gained a total of 6,500 pageviews on the CDKN website, and nearly 15,000 impressions and over 400 engagements on Twitter over the period June 2020-May 2021.

## How CDKN achieved this impact

From 2018 - 2022, the CDKN Knowledge Accelerator developed:

Communications toolkits (comprising explainer guides, infographics, slides and images) for Africa, Asia and Latin America based on the IPCC's Special Reports on Land and the Ocean and Cryosphere.

African sub-regional factsheets, with African IPCC authors and in partnership with the African Climate and Development Initiative, compiled information from the Africa chapter of AR6 relevant to each of the continent's sub-regions (North, East, West, Central and southern Africa).

All materials were translated into other languages (French, Spanish, Portuguese and Arabic) for wider use.

CDKN co-organised and provided communications support for outreach events to share the IPCC messages with decision-makers, communicators and practitioners, including:

- Convening two sessions at the African Climate Risk Conference for African IPCC authors for the Land and Oceans Special Reports to present key findings to over 100 researchers and practitioners in October 2019. CDKN also provided special training to 30 African journalists at this conference, where journalists could engage directly with IPCC authors and receive story guidance.

- Organising a dissemination and peer-learning workshop to localise the IPCC Land and Oceans Special Reports to the Ghanaian audience. 54 stakeholders from government institutions, academia, local and international organisations attended. The localised documents supported government intention and plans to improve coastal and land management as stated in several of Ghana's development plans. They furthermore reiterated the need to introduce an integrated approach to reducing coastal floods, erosion and land degradation and enact appropriate legislation.

--- Page 2 ---

In Latin America, sharing key messages and CDKN toolkits with 500 people at an online event co-organised with the IPCC Working Group III in April 2020.

Promoting and sharing key IPCC findings for the launch of the AR6 Africa chapter, as well as a variety of webinars targeting Central Africa (IDRC event), East Africa (Kenya Meteorological Department and African Group of Negotiators Experts Support event), Southern Africa (ACDI event) and West Africa (IDRC event) from March-June 2022. CDKN shared the factsheets and live-tweeted core facts from these events.

Effective translation and communication of IPCC material is a highly specialised skill. It requires an excellent grasp of the science, understanding IPCC conventions, for example, in terms of interpreting levels of scientific uncertainty, and sound communications expertise. Working in partnership with IPCC authors at all stages is critical. This ensures outputs are scientifically robust while CDKN's inputs help to shape messages that are simple, accessible and relevant.

Integrating gender and climate change across five ministries in Ethiopia

CDKN's achievement

The project improved the integration of gender and climate change across key government institutions in Ethiopia: the Ministries of Finance; Agriculture; Water and Energy; Transport and Logistics; Urbanisation and Infrastructure; Women and Social Affairs; and the Environmental Protection Authority.

Through the engagements by CDKN and other partners, a 'Community of Practice' on gender and climate change was formed. The platform was initiated to jointly plan and implement gender and climate change programmes across the country, in particular by facilitating coordination and accountability amongst the gender units in each Ministry. A further achievement of CDKN was that climate change actions and discussions have typically taken place between the Ministry of Finance and the Environmental Protection Authority, and did not include a strong gender and social inclusion component. After intervention by CDKN and other partners, the Ministry of Women and Social Affairs (formerly the Ministry of Women and Children's Affairs) became a more active partner in implementing gender and climate action within the country.

How CDKN achieved this impact

From 2019, CDKN worked with the Government of Ethiopia's Climate Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) Facility to improve the mainstreaming of gender in climate change priority sectors, institutions and projects. The CRGE Facility is the national climate fund that is co-managed by the Ministry of Finance and the Environment Protection Authority with a mandate to coordinate different actors working on climate change and to mobilise climate finance. Even though Ethiopia has made substantial progress in integrating gender responsiveness, climate resilience and climate change mitigation in both its policies and programmes, there were still gaps in integrating gender issues in climate change programmes and projects on the ground.

A needs assessment was conducted by two national experts (one in gender and one in climate change) in 2019. The assessment revealed that there was little clarity on how gender issues could be incorporated into the day-to-day operations of climate change focused government departments.

--- Page 3 ---

Moreover there were gaps in the awareness of frameworks being adopted by leading intergovernmental agencies on gender and climate change (this is important for the country to access international climate finance). There was a lack of institutionalisation, leading to poor gender-responsiveness in climate compatible planning and implementation, little accountability and monitoring, and a lack of sectoral coordination.

These findings led to engagements with stakeholders to discuss and prioritise the findings of the needs assessment. As a result of this prioritisation, CDKN produced a tailored training pack on gender and climate change that strengthened the awareness and capacity of government officials on these matters. Training on gender and climate change was provided with the CRGE Facility in December 2020. It involved 20 key participants, which included gender focal points from the various ministries. The aim of the training was to support the participants to mainstream gender equality considerations into all climate change initiatives in their respective ministries and sectors and to introduce the gender training pack. Institutionalisation was improved through the establishment of a gender and climate change community of practice.

d) Climate-Smart-Agriculture technologies adopted in Nepali municipalities

CDKN's achievement

The CDKN-supported sub-partner, Local Initiatives for Biodiversity, Research and Development (LI-BIRD), enhanced the capacity of the Ministry of Land Management, Agriculture and Cooperatives (Ministry of Land Management) as well as municipalities, farming communities, cooperatives and women farmers to implement Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) technologies and practices within the Gandaki and Sudurpashim regions of Nepal. LI-BIRD also improved the mainstreaming of CSA technologies and practices into provincial and local government policies, plans and programmes. Following implementation of the project, the Gandaki provincial office of the Ministry of Land Management increased their support from 72 to 87 villages under the Chief Minister Environment Friendly Model Agriculture Village Programme (Model Village Programme). Among these, several municipalities in Nepal adopted and promoted CSA technologies and practices and allocated budgets to support their implementation. Based on the work of the project, the Ministry of Land Management within the Gandaki province have requested further collaboration with LI-BIRD on climate risk-based planning and action-oriented research which may further improve climate resilience in the area.

Capacitated and influenced by the training LI-BIRD conducted on CSA, another province, Sudurpaschim, also included the concept of a climate-smart village in their Model Village Programme and have signed a MoU with LI-BIRD seeking their collaboration and technical support in scaling-up CSA practices, and the conservation and promotion of local agro-biodiversity across the province.

How CDKN achieved this impact

The enhancement in capacity for CSA and integration of CSA in national plans and policies was achieved through a range of knowledge products and on the ground activities that targeted the range of stakeholders directly. This included, for instance, ensuring outputs were distributed in Nepali as well as English, and having separate training, engagement and knowledge outputs for the various audiences, including for women farmers.

A training manual on 'Climate Smart Agriculture' was produced in collaboration with the Ministry of Land Management in Gandaki Province and the 'Compendium of Climate-Smart Agriculture

--- Page 4 ---

Technologies and Practices' was also developed in partnership with the Ministry of Land Management in Gandaki Province and the CGIAR Research Programme on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS). Co-development of knowledge products led to buy-in from key actors, the Ministry of Land Management in this case, who adopted the training manual and disseminated it to other departments, agencies and municipalities for further uptake and implementation.

Throughout the project, LI-BIRD engaged with the municipalities, farming communities, cooperatives and vulnerable women farmers through training and practical demonstrations promoting gender-responsive CSA practices. LI-BIRD also provided gender-responsive agricultural tools to vulnerable women farmers. Continuous discussions, training and handholding of the range of key actors, such as the chairperson, ward chairs, executive members of the municipalities as well as farming communities, sensitised and capacitated them towards the usefulness of CSA practices and promoted their integration in the annual budget of the municipalities.

Improving the integration of gender and climate change in climate change policies in Ecuador

## CDKN's achievement

CDKN has become a well-known and respected partner for capacity building on gender and climate change in Ecuador. The team has shared conceptual and technical approaches as well as instruments, tools and methodologies to integrate gender into climate action at the state and civil society levels. These have been implemented at local, national and regional levels.

The CDKN Ecuador team receives numerous inquiries for technical assistance from government institutions such as the National Council for Gender Equality and the Ministry of Environment, as well as from civil society organisations such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and CARE to support knowledge brokering on gender and climate change. In addition, FFLA, as a member of the Technical Table on Gender and Climate Change (MTGCC), provided technical support for the development of two national policies: The Gender and Climate Change Action Plan and the National Adaptation Plan.

## How CDKN achieved this impact

A CDKN training course on gender and climate change developed from November 2018 to July 2019, highlighted the need to have a structured space for regular dialogue on gender and climate change issues. As such the CDKN Latin American team and the Ministry of Environment in Ecuador joined forces with the National Council for Gender Equality and the NDC support programme of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to establish the Technical Table on Gender and Climate Change ("the Table"). This technical table has the objective of promoting gender equality and sustainable development in the country, and in particular the members of the Table work to advance in the integration of the gender approach in the national climate change policy.

Since its creation, this intersectoral working group has brought together public actors, civil society organisations and researchers, on a monthly basis, to exchange lessons and experiences on the integration of gender and climate issues, sharing data and identifying synergies. The Table developed an initial diagnostic study to document initiatives on gender and climate change at the subnational level in the country, and has since produced a booklet and action plan to 2025 that includes a number of key actions, such as the development of a financing strategy, the compilation of good institutional practices, a research agenda, as well as peer learning and exchange activities.

--- Page 5 ---

CDKN through FFLA has provided guidelines on how to strengthen the governance of the Table and has proposed the incorporation of representatives of social movements, particularly women and the LGBTIQ+ population.

From the foundation of the technical table in April 2019 until December 2021, CDKN has played a crucial advisory and strategic coordination role facilitating the meetings and developing agendas and taking minutes. After implementing and ensuring a smooth transition process, IUCN has taken on this role, demonstrating interest from the members of the technical table in continuing the consolidation of the Table and the importance of promoting its sustainability. CDKN has therefore created a well-established, self-sustaining and on-going national public and social process.

## Research Outputs

List up to 10 most important research outputs generated by the project. Where possible, provide the link.

CDKN generated 550 knowledge products and tools during this project and all of them are open access. CDKN is a knowledge broker organisation, and therefore a starting point is that knowledge products are only ever the first step in efforts toward impact. In this context, selecting just 10 outputs and discussing them individually would not show the true value of outputs and their impact. In some cases, below, I therefore share a collection of outputs and explain their significance as a collection and in relation to associated outreach efforts in order to better illustrate the importance of these outputs.

## Gender training resources

CDKN developed gender training resources to help climate and development professionals to integrate gender perspectives into climate projects and programmes (available at www.cdkn.org/gendertraining and http://www.cdkn.org/cajageneroycc). The training pack comprises modules, each with presentations and interactive exercises for facilitators; and also four regionally adapted 'Climate and Society' card game packs (available at www.cdkn.org/climategame) that help participants to explore climate risk through an intersectional lens.

Although originally intended for in-person use, the training materials can all be delivered online, including the game. They have been used in many different contexts, including training at/for: UNFCCC Gender and Climate Country Focal Points (with this pack published by the UNFCCC Secretariat), the UN Women Training Centre, the Adaptation Futures Conference, the Community-based Adaptation Conference, the ICLEI World Congress, the Under 2 Coalition, CDKN Asia regional training, CDKN Latin America regional training, and CDKN Ethiopia training for government officials. The training materials have had strong uptake and positive user ratings across government and NGO groups.

## IPCC fact sheets for Southern, East, Central, North and West Africa

Between March and June 2022, CDKN collaborated with the lead authors of the IPCC's Africa Chapter in Working Group 2 of the 6th Assessment Report to produce briefs that summarised key data at regional scales for Africa. This work was significant because the IPCC Assessment Report only contained Africa-wide data, and continent scale, but this is not always helpful to decision makers in specific countries on the continent. Both the authors and CDKN therefore dedicated significant time to creating down-scaled fact sheets that were more user friendly. Between March and June 2022 alone these fact sheets were viewed over 1,000 times, downloaded 450 times collectively, and shared

--- Page 6 ---

extensively on social media and in webinars, During COP27 in Egypt in November 2022 it emerged that the African Group of Negotiators were making daily use of these fact sheets in their negotiations, providing clear evidence of how useful these outputs have been.

These fact sheets are available in a variety of languages, here:

Suite of materials building comprehensive heat resilience in South Asian cities

A collaboration between CDKN and Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre (RCCC) led to the development of a suite of scientific, city-specific materials that built heat resilience, targeting municipal officials, urban practitioners and Nepalgunj in Nepal, and Rajshahi in Bangladesh. The outputs included a report on the Identification of Heat Thresholds and Heat Hotspots in Nepalgunj and Rajshahi, policy briefs Reducing Heat Impacts in Nepalgunj City, Nepal and Rajshahi, Bangladesh, an Early Warning Guidance Note on Early Warning Early Action (EWEA) in Secondary Cities in South Asia, and a Heat Communication Guide for the Cities in South Asia, which included a set of communication materials in the form of flyers, posters, social media posts, videos in English as well as in Bengali and Nepali to facilitate accessibility and maximum outreach. In total more than 20 outputs were produced and used in Nepal and Bangladesh. The heat threshold reports and the Information, Education and Communication materials in local languages were a first of their kind in the countries. The products have been lauded by stakeholders such as the German Red Cross Society (GRCS), Bangladesh Red Crescent Society (BDRCS), Danish Red Cross Society (DRCS), Nepal Red Cross Society (NRCS) who have expressed interest in using them widely in the region given the critical risk of heat waves due to climate change, and substantial actions on heat risks have not been undertaken yet in Bangladesh and Nepal.

Enabling smallholder farmers in Kenya and Uganda to adapt to climate change through SMS-based tool for climate information, combined with training and outreach

The East African Grain Council (EAGC) built the capacity of smallholder farmers in Kenya and Uganda in the areas of planting, crop management, harvest and post-harvest management. The project shared timely weather forecasts and updates through an SMS-based system which allows farmers to proactively respond to weather variability. This tool was paired with workshops with farmers that showed the usefulness of different tools and practices that can enable more climate-resilient farming, as well as connecting these farmers with suitable suppliers of these products. This included practices such as the use of tarpaulins for drying of grains (to prevent infestation of mould), hermetic storage bags for grain storage (which helps reduce pest infestation and keeps the grain at a better quality for longer), and the use of equipment and practices for minimum tillage, a land preparation method that minimises soil manipulation to reduce erosion and compaction.

This suite of activities has benefited over 4,000 farmers who are members of the EAGC supported farmer G-hub (groups of farmers that farm similar areas and grains). Farmers have been able to

--- Page 7 ---

increase the resilience of their crops, reduce post-harvest losses, and access better markets for their grains, all of which translate to improved incomes for smallholder farmers. For instance, Kitise G-hub increased their number of hermetic bags used at their collection centres by 43%, from 350 to 500, while Kibwezi east G-hub reported that a significant number of farmers were using conservation agriculture methods (such as minimum tillage) and that this has increased the resilience of their harvests.

Furthermore, farmers from the Makueni Conservation group, an area prone to drought, have planted Sorghum, an indigenous grain which is suited to dry conditions. The group have also planted Glycidia, a fast-growing shrub that can improve nitrogen levels in the soil and recycle nutrients, after the EAGC linked the group with one of the farmers in their network who has started a nursery for Glycidia plants. Both of these actions represent farmers adopting practices that improve their resilience to climate variability. Finally, farmers in the Molo sub county covered their grains with tarpaulins in advance of predicted heavy rainfall based on forecasts from the SMS tool.

## Country-specific training packs developed for local government officials on climate resilient planning in Nepal and Bangladesh

CDKN produced two training packs, containing PowerPoint modules and briefing manuals adapted for online and face-to-face situations that provide an integrated and contextualised urban/ rural approach to building resilience in local governments in Nepal and Bangladesh. These outputs were produced in response to requests by the Ministry of Forests and Environment in Nepal as well as requests from participants of Bangladesh cities in regional CDKN training programmes to train and build the capacity of municipal authorities in climate resilient planning.

The Training Modules are targeted to senior to mid-level municipal officials, such as environmental engineers, health officers and urban planners from the local authorities, elected representatives and executives/ professionals from local bodies/ other government agencies as well as practitioners and other decision-makers involved in climate resilience planning. Gender and social inclusion were integrated into the training modules to address the gap in considering gender and social inclusion dimensions while executing climate resilience plans by municipalities. The training modules were specifically modified to address Nepal and Bangladesh contexts by modifying the examples and cases discussed in the presentations.

## Guide on empowering subnational actors for climate action from Colombia

In Colombia, more than 50% of greenhouse gas emissions are due to activities that take place at the subnational level, such as agriculture, deforestation and land-use change. As such in order to meet its global commitments, the national government considered it essential to transfer climate considerations, commitments and actions to the territorial and municipal levels. One of the biggest challenges in this regard was how to continue sensitizing the new leaders of local governments every four years in all the 1,113 Colombian municipalities to ensure that climate actions were included in their development plans.

In this context, the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development partnered with the CDKN team in Colombia to develop a guide to empower subnational actors for climate action. The guide aims to provide dynamic and user-friendly guidance, tools and inspirational examples that will help mayors and local governments to include low-carbon and climate-resilient management strategies in their planning instruments.

--- Page 8 ---

In 2020, Colombia increased the ambition of its NDC to reduce emissions from 21 to 51%, including responsibilities of local governments (in terms of mitigation and adaptation) to meet the objectives of the NDC of the country. In response, a second part of the guide was produced by the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development and CDKN in 2021 for subnational decision-makers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and design and implement climate change mitigation and adaptation measures in line with the new NDC goals.

The guide uses easy to follow non-technical language and has become a useful tool in informing and inspiring decision makers at the subnational governments to implement mitigation and adaptation actions aligned to their development plans and contributing to achieve the goals of the Colombian NDC. It also provides guidelines for municipalities and mayors to achieve the goals, presenting a step-by-step guidance and showing concrete examples of projects implemented in the framework of Climate Change Local Plans that have already contributed to the commitments regarding the NDC. The digital form of the guide has been useful in allowing more officials to be reached.

If appropriate, explain why outputs were not completed or were of poor quality.

## Project Outcomes

How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

CDKN has significantly innovated in the field of climate knowledge brokering, redefining the methods through which we understand knowledge and evidence is put into policy and practice. Through this project, CDKN responded to the challenge that a vast amount of knowledge on climate action already exists, but that it is not being used. The project recognised that the decision-making space itself is a highly complex environment, influenced by societal values, norms, power dynamics and regulations and that knowledge does not automatically result in a change of decisions or actions. The programme used a range of knowledge brokering approaches, moving along a spectrum from knowledge translation – which involves making information more accessible and relevant – all the way to innovation brokering, which is focussed on facilitating systemic change.

In the knowledge translator role, CDKN maximised the uptake and impact of existing knowledge, tailoring and synthesising knowledge to make it more relevant to the needs of their target audiences. This worked towards the achievement of their objective: to increase the accessibility and relevance of the knowledge and learning generated on climate and development. Examples of outputs produced under this stream of work include the gender training pack for Latin America, CDKN's regionally tailored IPCC AR6 factsheets, and the suite of products contextualised to building heat resilience in Nepal and Bangladesh, all covered in the results and outputs sections above.

In their knowledge broker role, CDKN went beyond the production of outputs to support the use of knowledge and learning by key actors in decision-making and climate action. This was largely implemented through the Outreach and Engagement work package and contributed to the achievement of their second objective: to maximise the uptake, use and collective impact of knowledge and learning.

--- Page 9 ---

Examples of impacts arising from this area of work were local radio programmes in Ghana to share information on the practices of alternative livelihoods and various governmental services available to women in the region, and their work in disseminating lessons and learning from CDKN at a series of events at the UNFCCC COP26 in 2021.

As an innovation broker, CDKN employed a focus on peer learning, with the intention of achieving their third objective: enhancing leadership and collaboration on the implementation of climate action through facilitated peer learning and engagement. Here key actors were supported by peers to become more networked, influential and persuasive champions of climate action, building capacity and facilitating the uptake of knowledge. An example of this was the peer learning component of the Non-Motorised Transport activities in Kenya where two peer learning forums in Kenya enabled three cities – Nairobi, Kisumu and Mombasa – to learn from each other on the design and implementation of Non-Motorised Transport in their respective cities.

CDKN has thus generated significant impact in their core thematic focus areas (gender and inclusion; cities; climate finance and the water-energy-food nexus) as the impacts and outputs sections above attest. CDKN has also developed a core methodology on how to do knowledge brokering work effectively. A synthesis of lessons learned about effective approaches to knowledge brokering is under development and forthcoming.

How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

Since this is a demand-led knowledge brokering project, and not a traditional research project, this project is replete with unanticipated outcomes. In fact, there is not a single outcome that has been achieved that was foreseen at the start of the project, and yet the project has exceeded all expectations with regard to impacts.

One of the key risks managed by the programme officer from the start of the project was the lack of clarity of final impacts that characterize a demand-led project. This risk was managed through investment early-on in a monitoring, evaluation and learning system that would allow CDKN to capture and report on outcomes in a robust way. This early investment paid off substantially; it is the reason we now have a such a rich host of stories of impact to refer to from this project.

One aspect of the project that received less attention than initially intended was the peer learning component. This was primarily due to the COVID pandemic. Peer learning activities had been planned for 2020, and were designed primarily as face-to-face engagements to allow relationship building between peers working in governments and organisations around the world to share their lessons learned about gender-integrated climate policy. The COVID pandemic caused significant delays in these activities and indeed many peer learning activities had to be cancelled since it was not possible to hold the same kinds of engagements online. CDKN therefore shifted some of their attention during 2020 to more desktop synthesis (since this was the key activity that was possible during global lock-down conditions). This resulted at least in part in the very significant over-shoot of output targets (550 outputs instead of the expected 60). Two no-cost extensions during the pandemic allowed more time for these activities, and indeed CDKN did meet its peer learning targets, illustrating the perseverance of the CDKN team.

How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.

Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy.

Provide specific numbers where possible.

This project was developed under the 2015-2020 strategic plan. As a large-scale knowledge brokering programme covering Africa, Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean, with the explicit intention of enhancing the quality of life of the poorest and most vulnerable to climate change, this project was directly aligned with IDRC's objective of investing in knowledge for large-scale positive change. The programme worked in-depth to achieve impact in nine countries through both policy influence and capacity building of research users and emerging leaders. Given the investment in this project in peer-learning and training specifically, this project also supported IDRC's objective of building leaders for today and tomorrow, and did so across the developing world.

The project was aligned with the Climate Change Program Outcome Pathway as it was designed to contribute to one of its key outputs: "Gender sensitive climate knowledge made accessible for adaptation planning, investment, policy and/or practice by communities, governments and private sector" and all its Intermediate Outcomes. It directly targeted the Development Outcome "improved governance for better policies and services", and also contributed to "improved human security and gender equity" and "enhanced environmental sustainability".

Since this project was funded through a partnership between the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) and IDRC, the project contributed to the Agriculture and Environment 2015-2020 Implementation Plan, by ensuring greater update of knowledge to enhance resilience to climate change. The partnership contributed to positioning IDRC as a partner of choice with the Netherlands, helping to diversify the Centre's donor partners, a priority for both the Centre and the Climate Change program at the time.

The partnership helped to position IDRC as a key partner in climate change adaptation research with major global climate change programs of MoFA and FCDO. For example, lessons learned from CDKN were integrated into the design of the CLARE program, and indeed the potential role of CDKN in CLARE was a matter of significant discussion in the CLARE program design phases. FCDO attended CDKN's mid-term evaluation meeting in The Hague in 2019; MoFA attended a CLARE design workshop in London (UK) in 2020; and FCDO also attended the inception meeting for the next phase of CDKN in 2022. The strong performance of CDKN, and IDRC's ability to support, monitor and report on this performance, was also illustrated in the signing of a new partnership agreement with MoFA in 2022, for a further five years of programming for the Step Change program.

In some ways, the focus of CDKN in this project preceded, and perhaps contributed toward, some key aspects of Strategy 2030. For example, climate change and equity are cross cutting themes in Strategy 2030, as they were in CDKN during this project. CDKN focus on knowledge brokering, and IDRC's strategic objective on supporting knowledge sharing for greater uptake and use, and subsequent focus on knowledge sharing under Strategy 2030, are also cognate. CDKN's lessons learned will continue to be important to IDRC moving forward under Strategy 2030

# Financial performance

Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

The project was funded through an Externally Funded Program (EFP) supported by funding from the MoFA Netherlands and IDRC. A total of CA$ 10,006,800 was allocated to SouthSouthNorth for the implementation of this Knowledge Accelerator Project. SouthSouthNorth sub-granted to core partners, and provided small grants to sub-projects selected through a competitive call. In the end, SouthSouthNorth was able to spend this grant almost fully, with just under $100,000 remaining unspent, equating to a remarkable 1% underspend on this substantial grant, despite the challenges created by the pandemic in 2020 and 2021 and multiple sub-grantees.

The lead partner and recipient was SouthSouthNorth, an institution based in South Africa and with whom IDRC had no previous experience working with as a grantee. A desk assessment by GAD in 2018 resulted in a medium risk rating which would normally translate into annual financial and technical reports. However, given the high rhythm of expenditure (3 M CA$/yr) and the timing of reporting, GAD and the PO agreed that an annual financial report would be requested for Year 1 but semi-annual reports for the remainder of the grant, in order to closely monitor overspending or delays due to currency exchanges or slow delivery of activities and expenditures. This proved to be an important

decision that assisted to track both underspending by the grantee, account interest and exchange rate gains on a regular basis. I would recommend that this approach is also taken in future for grants of this size and complexity, despite the outcomes of a desk assessment which looks only at the organisation in question. In this sense, collaboration between the PO and GAD was critical in the start-up phases of this project.

Exchange rate gains proved so significant in 2020, in addition to the slow spend rate of the grantee, that a no-cost extension was granted in order to allow the grantee to make full use of funds. In 2021 a second no-cost extension was granted, again due to further delays in expenditure due to COVID 19, and account interest gains. The remarkable achievement of this grantee spending 99% of their grant, despite the many currencies in play, was in no small part due to this project having a dedicated Grants Officer with the ability to work with grantees through highly complex budget calculations to ensure the full usage of the grant. It was also due in large part to the regular financial reporting of the grantee despite a desk top review advising a different approach.

## Strategic Considerations

Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

Three key risks were identified at the outset, and all three were managed effectively and resolved. The first was the approach adopted, specifically the concern about being able to monitor and report on a demand-led project where outcomes could not be defined at the outset. The investment in expert Monitoring Evaluation and learning support was fundamental to resolving this risk. Indeed, CDKN's MEL system was described by the donor partner as an example of "best practice". The risk identified at the start was the relatively short implementation window for the project, despite its size. This risk remained throughout the project, and was finally resolved in two no-cost extensions during the lifespan of the project. A key lesson is to set realistic timeframes at the start in order to avoid the need for extensions. A third risk identified at the outset was the expectation that the success of CDKN may depend on their relationships with other research-oriented programs, described in the proposal as knowledge basis projects. This risk was overcome through CDKN issuing a call for proposals to these and other programs for small grants intended to generate collaboration with CDKN. This was highly successful, especially in Africa. This risk was thus largely resolved after the second year of the program.

A critical new risk that emerged during the project were a risk of financial underspend due to a combination of slow spend rate that was further exacerbated by COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns in 2020 and 2021, exchange rate gains and account interest gains. This risk was actively managed through close collaboration between GAD, the PO and SouthSouthNorth's technical and financial teams. 6-monthly financial reporting was required from the grantee despite this not being strictly necessary according to IDRC rules, and through the granting of 2 no-cost extensions in close collaboration with our donor partners.

Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

The project approval document (PAD) stipulated that the project would adhere to the IDRC Corporate Principles on Research Ethics, which are aligned with generally accepted principles of research ethics. The overall level of ethical risk was rated as low given that original research would not take place. This conclusion in the PAD stemmed from the fact that ethics procedures are focused on research processes, leading to the assumption that they are not strictly relevant for a knowledge brokering project.

In hindsight, I feel that this approach was inadequate and did not fully appreciate the ethical risks that could be associated with any process that involves the sharing of knowledge. In future, the identification or development of ethical principles specifically for knowledge translation or knowledge brokering projects should be a priority for the center. In the new phase of CDKN under the Step Change initiative, CDKN will be supported by the program officer to develop ethical guidelines and protocols for knowledge brokering activities. These guidelines should be useful across IDRC as we strive for Strategy 2030's emphasis on knowledge sharing.

## Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.
