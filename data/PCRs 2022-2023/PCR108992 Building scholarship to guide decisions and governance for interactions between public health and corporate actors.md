# Project Abstract

Discussions about collaboration and partnerships between public and private sector actors have entered the global health discourse, particularly to help deliver results towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition. In parallel, public health researchers and practitioners are weighing the advantages and disadvantages of support and funding from the corporate sector. This has led to a growing interest by public health professionals to document, understand and address concerns about governance, ethics, and conflicts of interest which may arise during interactions between public health actors and corporations.

In response, the Governance, Ethics, and Conflicts of Interest in Public Health (GECI-PH) Network in Beirut was established as a research and action network to examine the benefits and challenges in engaging with commercial sector actors, and to promote institutional safeguards and measures that protect public health goals in research, professional practice, and policymaking. The Network has expanded membership to 122 members by October 2020, increasing the diversity of expertise and location. A Coordinating Committee met every three months to discuss upcoming issues and finalize decisions. Five meetings were held between July 2019 and October 2020. The coordinators of the Network sought subsequent funding to support the maintenance of the Network through a new IDRC project "Building Scholarship to Guide Decisions and Governance for Ethical and Responsible Interactions between Public Health and Corporate Actors" which this report addresses.

This project supported GECI-PH to develop locally grounded but globally relevant learnings on this topic, and to advocate for more robust, transparent, and accountable scientific research and public health policymaking. A sustainable Southern-led network of practice was established to support collaboration of public health actors from Africa, Latin America, Asia, Middle East and Europe on the conceptual development and application of the commercial determinants of health in research and professional practice.

# PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

1) Publications: The project team contributed towards 2 publications for this project: a) In Globalization and Health: "A call to advance and translate research into policy on governance, ethics, and conflicts of interest in public health: the Governance, Ethics, and Conflicts of Interest in Public Health (GECI-PH) Network", and b) In International Journal of Public Health: "Factors associated with attitudes and practices of public health academics globally towards accepting research funding from for-profit organizations". This study claimed a second-place award among seventeen articles and editorials that were submitted to a call for proposal led by The International Journal of Public Health (IJPH) under a special issue on "market-driven forces and public health".

2) Participation to conferences: Participation in conferences served to increase the visibility of the GECI-PH Network and increase awareness of conflict-of-interest effects on health research in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). It provided opportunities for LMIC voices to be heard in fora that are mainly led and attended by high-income country (HIC) researchers. These conferences included: 6th Global Alcohol Policy Conference, 11th European Public Health Conference, American Public Health Association Conference, 6th Global Symposium on Health Systems Research, HSR2020, and the World Public Health Congress. The network funded the participation of speakers in the conferences in instances where alternative funds were not available. The Network also supported the attendance of 2 of its members to the 16th World Congress on Public Health 2020.

3) Building an online and social media presence: The project team built a social media presence through Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. The Network's Twitter account (@GeciPh) was active in posting activities, publications, and news of its members and in announcing its webinars. A webpage for the Network hosted under the Faculty of Health Sciences website at the American University of Beirut was developed: https://aub.edu.lb/fhs/Pages/GECI.aspx In addition, members of the network were receiving updates and news of through emails twice per month.

4) Advocacy activities: The team engaged in various advocacy activities. For example, on December 21, 2018 an advocacy letter was sent to the European Association for the study of obesity regarding the 26th European congress on obesity. The aim of the letter was to express objection to the involvement of the corporate industry sector in the 25th European Congress on Obesity (food, drink and drugs manufacturers and associated companies) which took place in Vienna, Austria from May 23rd till May 26th, 2018. The aim was to ask that future conferences be completely independent of such influences from corporate industry interests.

5) Webinars: A series of webinars were organized and moderated by Dr Melissa Mialon between December 2019 to February 2021, which increased the visibility of the Network, the knowledge it generated, and provided opportunities to engage with various audiences of interest.

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

This project built on lessons learned from project 106773 and a component of project 108238, which explored the emerging concept of the commercial determinants of a health, a new and growing field of inquiry in public health. This project supported the GECI-PH Network to develop locally grounded but globally relevant knowledge on this topic and to advocate for more robust, transparent and accountable scientific research and public health policymaking. A sustainable Southern-led network of practice was established to support collaboration of public health actors from Africa, Latin America, Asia, Middle East and Europe on the conceptual development and application of the commercial determinants of health in research and professional practice.

5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

The following questions were prioritized by the GECI-PH Network and then addressed through research fellowships, as well as through knowledge sharing and peer-peer learning at scientific conferences and online fora organized by the network.

- How can public health researchers, governments and donors better understand the private sector? How could research provide better understanding of this sector, the diversity of interests, and identify realistic and ethically-sound shared goals with public health actors?
- What capacities are needed for academics, corporate actors, civil society groups, and governments to reinforce positive linkages between the Sustainable Development Goals (particularly in relation to SDG17) and public heath accountability frameworks?
- How can a conceptual framework such as the 'commercial determinants of health' be used to understand how commercial actors can influence the healthiness of food systems in positive and negative ways and by extension, the prevalence of nutrition-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in the Global South?

The GECI-PH network also made a strong and concerted effort to develop mechanisms and processes to strengthen their network and improve the sustainability of research collaborations across institutions and geographic regions.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.

Invest in knowledge and innovation for large-scale positive change

This project contributed to this objective by informing the global debate around the role of the private sector in the prevention of NCDs through research, policies and interventions. Such understanding is needed to minimise disruptions to the provision of independent evidence to policymaking and to enable impactful, legitimate, and effective public-private interactions.

Build the leaders of today and tomorrow

This project supported emerging and established researchers from Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia to provide much-needed and timely evidence-based contributions to the global discourse on this topic. In undertaking this work, the project leaders (Drs. Rima Afifi and Rima Nakkash) and the Faculty of Health Sciences at the American University of Beirut have demonstrated global leadership by tackling a challenging but highly important topic in public health.

Be the partner of choice for greater impact

The funded work was timely and provided immediate value to IDRC, as it engaged in strategic planning around the role of the private sector in research-for-development funding. By providing a robust and locally grounded evidence base, this project helped to guide the Centre's thinking and to demonstrate its leadership among donor partners. It provided important knowledge on the benefits and challenges of engaging with the private sector and on institutional measures that can be adopted to safeguard public health and development outcomes.

# STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

One risk identified in the PAD was that the topics of the research scholarships would be determined over the course of this project's implementation, which made it difficult to assess potential risks and identify appropriate mitigation strategies at the pre-approval stage.

In order to manage these risks, the project team worked with a Scientific Committee tasked with selecting and overseeing these scholarships to identify and develop a risk management strategy for the research activities. In addition, IDRC held an observer role on this Scientific Committee so that additional guidance on risk identification and risk management was provided from the Centre's perspective.

There was also a moderate risk that this project draws criticism from corporate or public sector actors with a clear stance on the role of corporations in the cause or prevention of NCD risk factors. This project's scientific committee ensured a focus on developing rigorous, peer-reviewed research that promoted debate with public health actors as its primary interest.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

Nothing to highlight in this respect.

## Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

The GECI-PH which was established through this project remains very active, growing in membership and influential in public health and food systems fields for raising awareness about conflicts of interest and threats to the integrity of research and its outcomes as a result of COI. Members are called upon by the World Health Organisation in developing guidelines on COI and strengthening capacities of governments/Ministries of Health.

The project emerged out of a longer term and trusting relationship between IDRC and the Faculty of Health Sciences at AUB, particularly those who have conducted research on tobacco, alcohol food and NCD prevention. Despite their local challenges, this team has been incredibly persevering and ambitious in remaining helpful and relevant to the region and global debates on public health issues, including the commercial determinants of health. There is much that they could continue to contribute with additional support should the CRFS and/or GH programs seek to re-focus on strengthening capacities and practices in a world that is increasingly enthusiastic about exploring "partnerships" with the private sector.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC·CRDI

The project presented in this PCR was in line with the IDRC strategy and contributed towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The project aimed to advance a global research agenda that targets knowledge gaps related to non-communicable disease (NCD) prevention and provides locally grounded but globally relevant learnings for public health actors. It also aimed to identify realistic and ethically-sound shared goals with public health actors, specifically in understanding the private sector's role in NCD prevention.

The project's success was largely due to the establishment of a sustainable Southern-led network of practice. This network supported collaboration among public health actors from various regions of the world. As discussed by the PO and Team leader, this project demonstrated that collaborative networks are essential for advancing research and practice in public health. This strengthens the IDRC model, and future initiatives should prioritize building and sustaining collaborative networks to achieve the goals established in the 2030 vision.
