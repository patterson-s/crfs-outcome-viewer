# Project Abstract

The adoption of agri-mechanization in Kenya is very low with only 15% of the power for agricultural activities relying on machinery and equipment. Lack of adequate information on agri-mechanization, limited purchasing power by smallholder farmers, as well as the lack of sustainable business models to deliver agri-mechanization services to smallholder farmers are the main constraints facing adoption. The research question is: how can agri-mechanization support smallholder agriculture become an attractive enterprise, reduce drudgery for women and unemployment for youth, and provide fulfilling work for farmers? The goal of this action research project is to increase income and improve food security for 2,000 women and 1,500 men smallholder farmers and 480 youth entrepreneurs in Busia, Embu, Kiambu, and Meru Counties through agri-mechanization. The project proposes to use two strategies to increase access and utilization of agri-mechanization services: a digital platform to link smallholder farmers to agri-mechanization services, and a model of "Commercial Villages" to link smallholder farmers to markets in order to drive demand for agri-mechanization services. Expected results include improved agricultural productivity, labour efficiency and timeliness of operations, reduced drudgery, increased opportunities for youth employment, and increased incomes among smallholder farmers. The project is a collaborative initiative of Farm Concern International and the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization through the Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute.

# PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

- Piloting the Commercial Village Model in 20 villages in four counties, linking farmers to agricultural products' traders, agri-mechanization vendors, input dealers and financial institutions. The project improved the governance of these commercial villages and upgraded their commodity aggregation centers to enhance market linkages.
- Testing and validation through on-station and on-farm evaluations of 8 machines in four value chains (cassava, indigenous chicken, kales, and maize) prioritized in four counties (one value chain in each county).
- Upgrading of a digital platform with 2479 farmers and 120 traders registered in this platform within the framework of the project.
- Facilitation of partnerships with 12 financial institutions and 14 agri-mechanization vendors. These partnerships contributed to the acquisition of machineries by farmers and youth entrepreneurs in the Commercial Villages resulting in increasing productivity and income.
- Promotion of agri-mechanization through the digital platform, on-farm demonstrations, trade fairs, village business forums, and training workshops with the participation of around 5500 stakeholders.

The project explored an innovative business model for the promotion and adoption of agri-mechanization by smallholder farmers. This model is based on two pillars addressing two challenges: the first pillar is the digital platform addressing the challenge of inadequate information on agri-mechanization solutions, and the second pillar is the "Commercial Villages Model" addressing the challenge of limited market access. The hypothesis is that the improved market access of smallholder farmers to commodity buyers through Commercial Villages will improve farmers' income. Income improvement will allow them to purchase (or rent) agri-mechanization solutions which are promoted through the digital platform. Kenya is the only country in East Africa that offered the opportunity to test this model by the time the funding of this project was approved.

The project prioritized four value chains in four counties. These value chains formed the basis of agri-machinery identification, testing, validation, and promotion. The cost-benefit analysis of agri-mechanization was suggested by IDRC in the review of the proposal. This methodological tool was powerful in demonstrating to smallholder farmers the benefits of agri-mechanization adoption, including increased yields, reduction of production costs, time saving and reduced drudgery.

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?
Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

The goal of this action research project is to increase income and improve food security for smallholder farmers and youth entrepreneurs through agri-mechanization. The project is fully aligned with the main goal of the Agriculture and Food Security Program (AFS) which is “to support research that generates new options for more equitable and productive agriculture to improve food and income security for the poor and marginalized in developing countries”. Small machinery development is one of the focus areas of the AFS Implementation Plan 2015-2020. The project piloted the Commercial Village Model in four counties in Kenya with a focus on four value chains. It demonstrated the impact of agri-mechanization on increasing agricultural productivity, reducing drudgery, and improving income as well as the importance of market linkages to enhance its adoption. This tested model has the potential to be duplicated in other counties of the country.

5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?
Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

In reference to the PAD, the project was expected to facilitate market linkages and business partnerships for 4000 farmers (50% women) in 20 Commercial Villages from 4 counties. The endline survey of the project revealed that 5583 farmers were reached with 60% of them being women.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?
Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.
Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy.
Provide specific numbers where possible.

The project generated knowledge in exploring an innovative business model for the promotion and adoption of agri-mechanization. This model aims to improve income and food security of smallholder farmers. It was piloted in four counties and has the potential to be duplicated in other counties of Kenya. Thus, the project presents a contribution to IDRC’s first strategic objective of 2015-2020 Strategic Plan: Invest in knowledge and innovation for large-scale positive change.

Comment: The project succeeded through the Commercial Village Model and the affiliated aggregation centers in increasing the income of farmers engaged in the four prioritized value chains (according to the project's baseline and endline surveys). The project invested heavily in the promotion of agri-mechanization through the digital platform, on-farm demonstrations, trade fairs, village business forums, and training workshops with the participation of around 5500 stakeholders. It facilitated partnerships with financial institutions and agri-mechanization vendors which contributed to the acquisition of machineries by farmers and youth entrepreneurs. However, the adoption of agri-mechanization was at a low scale by the end of the project. This can be explained by the relatively short duration of the project (3 years) which was mainly invested in improving the governance of the Commercial Villages and their market linkages and in testing, validating, and promoting agri-mechanization in four prioritized value chains. The project laid the foundation in the four targeted counties for a potential large-scale adoption of agri-mechanization. That said, the occurred positive changes (mainly in terms of increased incomes) are more associated with improved marketing linkages (better farm gate prices and high volumes of sales through the upgraded aggregation centers of the Commercial Villages) rather than with the acquisition of agri-mechanization.

# Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

In the PCR report, the Project Officer emphasized the importance of a gender-sensitive approach, which the project team successfully demonstrated. By prioritizing the empowerment of women and youth in agriculture, the project achieved remarkable results, with 60% of the 5,583 affected farmers being women. This highlights the undeniable impact of targeting women and underscores the crucial role that gender equality plays in agricultural development and youth inclusion.

Another critical lesson to draw from the project is the impact of simple technology integration in agri-mechanization on people's livelihoods. The project leveraged technology through the implementation of a digital platform and the concept of "commercial villages," which increased access to agri-mechanization services. These strategies also fostered a demand for such services by connecting smallholder farmers to markets. This underscores technology's pivotal role in enhancing productivity and efficiency in agriculture.

In future initiatives, we must continue to explore and implement cutting-edge technological solutions to drive agricultural development while addressing the root causes of inequalities. Additionally, the project's success demonstrated the value of strategic partnerships, emphasizing the need for IDRC to support and facilitate collaborations in future projects.

I approve this PCR.
