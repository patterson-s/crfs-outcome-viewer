# Project Highlights

What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

Integrated approach and Group Model Building:

The project successfully used a methodology called Group Model Building to consider multiple levels of stakeholders and the complex issues being addressed to identify an integrated approach. Key stakeholders from multiple sectors in the three project countries (St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Jamaica) identified a number of insights relevant to the CARICOM region. Analysis suggested that health was not seen as a driver of consumer food choices, but rather cost and convenience were the major influencers, along with the impacts of climate change, natural disasters and other factors that in turn impact food imports. Recommendations included strengthening government regulations and increasing access to resources in the agriculture/agri-processing field through key leverage points. Accordingly, strategies for coordinated gender-sensitive package of system-wide intervention packages were identified by the research team.

The comprehensive and collaborative approach to address food security and diet related chronic diseases leveraged a favorable policy environment for improved agriculture and health in the region. As a result, advances were made through three pathways or entry points: schools, community and policy. Achievements confirm significant scientific merit in the integrated multi-disciplinary and multi-stakeholders approach adopted by the researchers.

Revisions to school curricula with emphasis on healthy diets and prevention of diet related non-communicable diseases:

The project team successfully worked with the Caribbean Examination Council (CXC) and CARICOM Secretariat Human Resource Development in revising the curricula of secondary and primary schools to include grade-appropriate and up-to-date information on Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and their prevention. The revisions were adapted for the Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate in 2020 and from 2022 CXC examinations were based on the new curricula. For the primary school level, the curriculum of Health and Family Life Education was revised while a new curriculum for the Early Childhood Development level was created. These revisions were approved by CARICOM Ministers of Education at their 38th Meeting in October 2019. In addition, the project also helped in the creation of school nutrition standards to improve the quality of food served at school lunches.

Policy impacts through evidence and advocacy for trans fat elimination

The project's efforts helped move the policy agenda to eliminate unhealthy trans fats (which are mainly found in hydrogenated oils used in commercially processed foods) known to be associated with a higher risk for diet related NCDs. Laboratory support for analysis of trans fats, salt and sugar levels in food samples along with policy recommendations contributed to ministerial level parliamentary debates on this topic. Despite initial failed attempts for policy change, continued advocacy in collaboration with the offices of health and trade ministers (including the direct support from the Health Minister in Jamaica) led to successful decisions to legislate the prohibition of partially hydrogenated oils by December 2023 and eliminate them by December 2025.

Community level results

With baseline studies showing that cost and convenience influence food choices, the project identified commonly available foods and listed practical information on preparing healthy meals at affordable price (i.e., "best buys") to help consumers make informed decisions. In addition, fifteen small grants using a gender responsive strategy along with technical support to local farmers and women's groups demonstrated how to implement agricultural activities to provide affordable healthy food choices for home consumption and to generate income. Some participating farmers groups even received certification for quality standards from the Ministry of Agriculture and secured opportunities for bulk supply to local restaurants.

The project team also forged relationships with influencers at the community level such as women's groups and faith-based organizations and provided them with simple messages and tools to promote healthy diets.

## Gender considerations and integration

The project integrated gender in the design, analysis and implementation. First the team conducted a baseline review of food and nutrition policies in the three focus countries to assess coherence of policy commitments to gender equality and sustainable development with national practices. This analysis helped to better integrate gender and inclusion as the project implemented activities aimed toward the reduction of NCD-risk factors for men and women of different demographic, socio-economic backgrounds. For example:

- relevant gender related training was integrated in the stakeholders' workshops with representatives of ministries of health, education and agriculture, and civil society.
- through the Women's Farmers Academy (in St Vincent and Grenadines and St Kitts and Nevis) 380 women received training in entrepreneurship via profitable agricultural enterprises, financial literacy, marketing and digital connectivity. Tools for women's empowerment and leadership skills were included to improve confidence, enhance participation in leadership roles and amplify voices in decision making.

## Project Outcomes

How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

This research was important to fund because during the past fifteen years a series of high-level reports from CARICOM and the Pan American Health Organization identified obesity, food and nutrition insecurity and resulting Non-communicable Diseases as major threats to human and economic development in the region. However, even after four major policy declarations between 2006 and 2010, progress in tackling these major public health problems has been slow. This is partly because clear evidence-based understanding of the contextual barriers and enabling factors to solving these region-wide problems remained elusive.

This project, building on findings from two previously funded IDRC projects, Farm-to-Fork in CARICOM and Evaluation of the Port of Spain Declaration implementation (POSDEVAL), identified practical options to link policy and programs in food and health, and harnessed evidence on ways to render local food systems more responsive to the challenge of obesity and NCDs.

As a result of the project, knowledge was generated that contributed to the understanding of cross-cutting socio-economic factors impacting the consumption of healthy diets and the need to increase capacity to integrate gender sensitivity in food and nutrition related policies &amp; programs. The main lessons learnt from this complex multi dimensional project include:

- the use of participatory methods involving a wide range of stakeholders is essential to identify priority areas for intervention
- champions are important to drive the process
- partnerships and networking play a significant role
- ongoing advocacy is needed for sustainability
- behaviour change takes time

How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

Overall, the project evolved as planned with the goal of investigating the policies and practices affecting the food system, and to engage with stakeholders in designing, implementing, and evaluating integrated packages of interventions that address key 'leverage points' within the systems, and disseminate the lessons. As the project evolved from earlier IDRC supported work in the region, it was less heavily focused on research but on implementation to address previously documented weaknesses and on dissemination of results and tools.

Due to the continued disruptions to field work and stakeholder meetings during the COVID-19 pandemic, the project adjusted data collection and advocacy methods. The research team pivoted relatively quickly into using online platforms and alternative communication methods.

Interruptions due to the pandemic were compounded by other major natural disasters in the study countries. For example, in St Vincent and the Grenadines, the volcanic eruption of La Soufrière in April 2021 followed by Hurricane Elsa in June 2021 compromised the country's capacity to participate in some of the interventions including school-based interventions which could not be conducted as schools were being used to shelter displaced citizens.

On the other hand, the project team also found a silver lining through the challenges and identified opportunities through "out-of-the-box" thinking and reconfiguration of planned activities to make them more efficient. Consequently, the project team conducted an analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on food security in the Caribbean and published "A COVID-19 opportunity: Applying a systems approach to food security and noncommunicable diseases" recommending attention to local food production and food sovereignty.

These important adjustments to project activities while maintaining the overall objectives in perspective helped to achieve remarkable results despite obstacles - a testament to strong leadership and stakeholder support.

How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy.

Provide specific numbers where possible.

This project was developed and implemented as part of the IDRC's 2015-2020 strategic plan. It contributed to the following strategic objectives:

Invest in knowledge and innovation for large-scale positive change

School curriculum revisions that included specific content on healthy diets, NCDs and their risk factors along with innovative training material has a potential to bring positive change in young children to make healthy choices. For example, in 2022 alone 17,293 children in CARICOM who studied the revised curriculum implemented in 2020 took their Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate examinations based on the new curricula.

Enhanced equipment and capacity to test sugar, salt and fat content of food products which identified that 40% of products tested contained trans fats allowed the Minister of Health Jamaica to lead the charge to advance the trans fat reduction/elimination policies. Additionally, learnings on healthy diets from the project interventions were incorporated into Jamaica's 2022-2030 National Strategic NCD plan and Parish NCD plans. These are significant policy contributions towards large scale impact given that unhealthy diets, especially ultra-processed foods, sugar sweetened beverages and inadequate fruit and vegetable intakes were identified to be major modifiable risks in the region where overweight and obesity rates among Caribbean women was 61% and among men 46%.

Project collaborations with grass root organizations including women's groups and churches helped to translate research finding and complex health recommendations into simple messages for community level knowledge dissemination on healthy eating. These contributions will continue beyond the project through various social media platforms and a dedicated website (onecaribbeanhealth.org) as repositories for the knowledge.

Build the leaders for today and tomorrow

The project provided opportunities of young researchers, many of them women, from Canada and the Caribbean to improve their research skills and future careers. For example, a post-doctoral candidate from McGill University (Ms. Arlette Saint Ville) who completed an 18-month fellowship is now a lecturer at the UWI St. Augustine campus. Two Masters of Public Health students from the study countries participated in advancing project research and graduated in 2019 and 2020 respectively.

Dr. Leith Dunn (the project's gender champion) from the Gender and Development Studies of UWI was named in 2019 among the top 100 most influential persons globally in gender policy and equality (she was the only person from the Caribbean in the list).

As a result of the project's policy influence, the Ministry of Health and Wellness in Jamaica invited Prof. Alafia Samuels (the Project PI) to continue to work with the ministry's team as they engage with the Jamaica Manufacturers and Exports Association to implement trans fat elimination policies.

## Financial performance

Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

A no-cost time extension of six months was granted which helped to makeup some of the delays caused due to the pandemic.

Despite the excellent research and policy level accomplishments of the project, the grant administration and financial reporting aspects have been a challenge throughout the project. It required periodic interventions by GAD colleagues to help the recipient institution UWI to understand and comply with IDRC grant administration guidelines. The closure of the financial side of the project was delayed due to an overrun of the budget by about 4%. An internal process is currently underway to complete the financial analysis and consider the options for the shortfall.

These grant admin related issues point to insufficient finance and administration capacity of UWI to administer large grants that also involve managing third party entities. Lessons from the project including those summarized by the project PI at the end of the project could inform future grants such as putting in place additional administrative controls and/or training.

# Strategic Considerations

Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

An important risk identified in the Project Approval Document was the complexity involved in a multi-partner, multi-country initiative which could pose the possibility for fragmentation. Overall, this risk was managed well through following a project communication and coordination plan.

One risk that could not be fully addressed was the challenges in garnering the interest of private sector (food industry partners and stakeholders). This happened in most part during the pandemic lockdown periods due to the drastic changes in the business environments and changing priorities among enterprises which resulted in limited participation of private sector players. However, towards the end of the project during the dissemination meetings there was some positive private sector responsiveness specifically related to trans fat elimination agenda which requires continued engagement with the private sector - especially the importers of partially hydrogenated oils, the major source of trans fats in the diet. This important work initiated during the project will continue beyond its closure.

Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

The project team was careful in managing research ethics in all aspects of the work. At the beginning of the project the project PI took additional training on "governance, ethics and conflicts of interest from corporate interactions in public health research, practice and policy" which helped facilitate working with a wide range of partners and collaborators.

Appropriate ethical approvals were obtained by relevant authorities in the three countries to facilitate project activities. For example, approvals in Jamaica were given by The University of the West Indies Mona Campus Research Ethics Committee and Ministry of Health &amp; Wellness; in St. Kitts and Nevis by the Interim Ethics Review Committee and Ministry of Health and Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries &amp; Marine Resources; in St. Vincent and Grenadines by the Ministry of Health, Wellness, and the Environment Research Ethics Committee and in Barbados by the Ministry of Education.

A key feature of the research protocols was obtaining informed consent. In cases where children's participation was involved, consents were received from the participants as well as their parents or guardians. Contact information for both the Principal Investigator and relevant research ethics committees were included in all consent survey forms.
