# Project Highlights

What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

Overall learning: STEP started by characterizing the attitudes held by secondary school students toward agriculture, working with the teachers of those students to strengthen instructional materials and methods, and then advising school systems on how best to channel career pathways toward modern agriculture. Studies were performed in three countries (DR Congo, Kenya, and Nigeria) across contrasting settings (peri-urban vs rural). It emerged that students interested in agriculture are attracted to higher value and value-added enterprises that avoid drudgery and utilize advantages from digital applications, interests that were characterized through combined graduate student research and IITA's M&amp;E expertise. STEP then assisted in the establishment of extracurricular agriculture clubs built around those principles. This resulted in a rich list of experimental activities and trainings described in the report. This effort was strongly influenced – by the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this shortcoming, STEP demonstrated a Proof of Concept with younger youth representing key targets for agricultural transformation; attracted considerable interest among students, instructors, and educational administrators alike; and set the stage for a more comprehensive effort (scaling).

Necessity to overcome barriers to learning and to interest in agriculture: Raising the interest of youth for agriculture is a hard effort that needs persistence. The project faced resistance by students: initially, more than 50% of students in the pilot schools and classes were unconvinced, and nearly half (46%) of the secondary school students that were averse to agriculture as a career path based their decision upon excessive labor requirements (30%), difficulties in securing land both for the school projects and in the future (25%), and projected low returns to effort (20%). This aversion was stronger in countries with less access to modern agricultural practices linked to information technologies, such as DRC, compared to Nigeria and Kenya. Perceptions and career plans among the sexes differed, with females having less experience with machinery and were more drawn to horticulture and agro processing. The initial unfavorable attitudes toward agriculture shifted in a good percentage of cases (~30%), and the study established that youth from the three countries recognize that opportunity exists from adopting modern farming methods and commercial agricultural enterprises.

Moving interest for agriculture into a younger age, where the mind is more dynamic: The team accepted the challenge – also thanks to the fact that this project came from an original idea of the IITA Director General, so had his full support. Retrospectively, it is surprising what the project could achieve in just 2 years. The result was a well designed and tested way to raise and enable teenagers' interest in agriculture, which has proven to be viable and scalable across a different rage of schools, not only wealthier ones. These efforts are novel because they probe into younger age the interest in agriculture, at a time when your people have not made up their mind yet, in most cases, on what to try to become or to choose as a profession, and where agriculture can be learnt as a creating activity rather than an effort to fulfill primary needs alone.

Opportunities for scaling: After gaining recognition in the host countries, both national and international organizations have begun to explore partnerships with IITA on possible means of out scaling the model. In Nigeria, the program has already been adopted into the school system in one of the states where the project was piloted. The project was able to showcase the efficacy of improving agriculture instructions for students and improving the overall education system of the state; hence, the rationale for

committing US$ 2.4M for its expansion to 12 more schools across the state.

The model is also currently promoted within a new youth project, the Innovative Youth in Agriculture (I-Youth) Project. This project results from the partnership between IITA and MasterCard Foundation. One of its purposes is to develop the agribusiness capacities of 9369 students directly (84 000 students indirectly) and teachers through the STEP Agribusiness model with the integration of a new hybrid approach, which incorporates community engagement. This expansion process in Nigeria means that STEP model will directly engage more than 15 000 students in over 100 secondary schools across five states (Kaduna, Kano, Lagos, Osun, and Oyo).

In DR Congo, scaling has proven more challenging so far. The project team is exploring partnership with Louvain Cooperation, and a new project is expected to run for five years, from 2022, but it has not been approved yet.

## Research Outputs

List up to 10 most important research outputs generated by the project. Where possible, provide the link.

Outputs are the directly achievable products of a project's completed activities (e.g. policy briefs, journal articles, research papers, trained people, etc.). Indicate the project outputs that were published on an open access basis. What, if any, outputs resulting from this project will be published open access beyond the duration of the project, and it is possible that the grantee will seek further IDRC support for this?

The project's initial operations in Year 1 focused on the design of appropriate agribusiness model channelled towards addressing the wrong perception of young people towards agriculture (established during the baseline survey exercise for students at the identified schools) and filling the existing school agriculture gap. The project also established ten extracurricular clubs in ten secondary schools across the three countries. These clubs opened opportunities to 1197 students to receive the agribusiness training packages designed into modules on modern agriculture. These activities were carried out before the COVID-19 outbreak.

Activities carried out within the first half of the project's Year 2 focused on understanding the scope of sustaining agribusiness interventions introduced in the nine schools and examining the effects of the three agribusiness development mechanisms among the students, schools, and communities at large. The project teams resumed physical in-school interactions with the beneficiary students after schools re-opened and commenced active engagement of agriculture teachers and instructors as part of the sustainability measures. Some of the school enterprises were diversified to open more untapped opportunities for young people and increase their participation in the project. Most of the pilot enterprises were analyzed, together with the students, to understand business models applicable to different agricultural value chains.

Main output of this phase: Peer reviewed paper: "Understanding the Perceptions of Secondary School Youth toward Agricultural Careers in Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya and Nigeria", in the Journal of International Agricultural and Extension Education (Volume 27, Issue 4).

This output was also distilled in a widely distributed poster presentation

The project continued to respond to the effects COVID-19 by leveraging on the available digital infrastructures in the schools and providing training to improve students' and teachers' digital skills. The project also received support for expansion to additional secondary schools. In Nigeria, the government sponsored the introduction of the model into six new schools based on the lessons success and lessons gathered from the project. As part of achieving its research obligations, the research team commenced study on the aspirations of students engaged in the project, towards agribusiness. The study centers on the three agribusiness mechanisms designed at the start of the project

Main output of this phase: Peer reviewed paper: An ICT Strategy Based upon E-Teaching and E-Learning in Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in Africa, Journal of International Agricultural and Extension Education (Volume 28(2), Special Issue 51)

The study presented in the paper was conducted in response to disruptions resulting from school closures as a COVID-19 precautionary measure. The paper described the process involved for secondary schools to shift from e-teaching by instructors (teachers) towards distance e-learning by students. It also addressed key issues such as digital applications used in facilitating learning, mobile-based toolbox by farmers, and key factors contributing to the constraints to device ownership and e-learning opportunities.

Finally, activities for the final phase (second half of Year 2) of the project focused on assessing STEP interventions based on the agribusiness model tested across Kenya, Nigeria, and DR Congo; and its expansion to more secondary schools and communities, through interventions from various stakeholders (local and international organizations). The findings of the research assessment will be published as a third paper of the project.

## Project Outcomes

How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

Importance of the work: We aim to transform food systems in a more just, resilient, and sustainable way. One way to contribute to this transformation, is by changing the behaviour of key actors in the systems, or of future actors, and by raising interest in playing an active role in the transformation process. Behavioural change is not easy, and it has higher rates of success if promoted at young ages, in this case when people are exploring learning about future occupation options. This project is all about behavioural change of future potential leaders of the food systems' transformation. Moreover, the project publications contribute fill a gap in the literature, so a high number of citations can be expected.

## Main Findings:

Role of e-technology in agricultural education, in a time of pandemics: while the various digital applications offer exciting implications for agricultural modernization, they must be kept in perspective, both in terms of E-Teaching and E-Learning. E-training is intended to supplement practical

--- Page 3 ---

understandings and experiential learning, not replace it. Students of agriculture should spend as much, if not more, time engaged in field practical experimentation as in front of screens. While young farmers should be proud of their digital toolkits and the number and types of applications they contain, the device itself should be used in a way that supplements farm productivity and food systems transactions, not replace them. This "reality check" applies to the anticipated COVID-19 aftermath where a boost in agricultural modernization is needed. The focus must remain to digitize the next generation of farmers and agribusiness persons for productivity to secure Africa's economic future with the recognition that digital tools complement production operations in terms of better farm planning, field diagnostics, and market intelligence, but does not replace them.

How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

The project reached all intended results except to one of truly initiating a scaling up process. Despite its relatively small budget, the work was very field-intense and involved a lot of human interactions. The project could have benefitted from field visits by the PO, to better elicit potential for scaling and new phases that explored more explicitly not only the interest of youth in agricultural innovation, but also on specific dimensions linked to sustainability, such as climate change and agro-ecology. However, the Covid-19 travel ban prevented all direct visits to the field activities and forced the team to reorganize the way they interacted with students. The PO inherited the project in a very mature stage, with few opportunities to change its course. At the same time, the work may not have gotten the attention it deserved because it was conducted while IDRC was transitioning into a new phase, with the closure of the AFS program and the opening of the CRFS division with a slightly different focus, both thematic and in terms of interest in small exploratory initiatives. All this contributed to slowing down the initial ambition towards scaling, even though the model remains viable and could be further explored now that school programs are fully operational. It may even be a model of interest for the Step Change partnership, when it comes to knowledge brokering focusing on youth agency.

Learning specific to Covid-19 evolving conditions – How the project modified some activities to turn them in a flexible model to learn from, robust to shocks and adjustable to evolving needs and groups: the duration of the project was short (two years), the budget (~300k) small compared to a typical IDRC research project, and it involved a lot of field activities that had to be conducted in a time when most schools had to remain closed (some in Kenya with a very tight regime) due to the COVID-19 impact and response measures. This was one of those IDRC funded projects that not only was designed and started before the pandemic, but it was active almost exclusively during the period of lockdowns and closed during the pandemic. This obliged the team to operate a radical reorganization of the school activities and even a revisiting of some of the research questions, as the challenges students and teachers faced had a repercussion on the training modules, on the reporting and MEL project systems, but also on their mental status and their evolving interests. For instance, some teachers involved in the project lost interest when they had to move the activities remotely, because the lack of interactions did not justify the extra effort tin their views, or because they had to take care or more urgent and pressing family needs – often linked to increased food insecurity. In other cases, the forced period at home and its related challenges had the opposite outcome, with students realizing the importance of urban agriculture and horticulture and using what they were learning through the project to push their parents and siblings to help them setting vegetable gardens. Those who had access to internet and social

networks used took advantage of the lockdown to share experience online with their peers and their teachers. The project was swift at recognizing these evolving changes and embrace opportunities that came with them. Online training modules and social gatherings to discuss challenges and ideas – comparable to online hackathons dedicated to household level agricultural experiments – were organized by the project team and helped to bypass the reduced interest of some teachers in the schools' farmers clubs. They also allowed a greater participation by students, in particular women, who had been less active in the in-person school farmers' clubs. This resulted in a stronger overall interest by female students, and in general to a model that may be more scalable at the national level. However, these adjustments did create other forms of exclusion, among students with little or access to internet, or among students who had little space at home to express themselves (violent or abusive situation in the household, lack of land, however minimal, that could replace the small plots of the school garden, to experiment with). Therefore, the project ended up by highlighting how inclusion and exclusion determining agency constraints in food systems transformation, albeit being based on entrenched inequalities, are highly context specific and can evolve in time.

## Financial performance

Are there any lessons or observations about the granting process, the financial performance of the project, or IDRC's administration of the project that could inform future programming or Centre processes?

## Strategic Considerations

Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

Yes, risk mitigation strategies were fully effective, although they had to be adjusted because impacts of Covid could not be foreseen at the time of the preparation of the PAD.

In addition to the ethical risk discussed in the next section, the PAD had identified the following: The fact that aspirations of young people may be too skewed to influence them into agriculture, schools may not appreciate the importance of integrating agriculture and agribusiness curricula and extra curricula activities and technologies and markets may not be sufficiently available to support the widespread adoption of higher value crops and agro-processing enterprises started by the clubs.

The mitigation strategies proposed including vetting and careful selection of schools and linking with private sector companies located in towns and cities around the schools were adequate to address these risks. The interest of students oscillated a lot and was also influenced by deteriorating households' conditions for some of them during the covid-19 lockdowns. However, this was incorporated as part of the research protocols. The scaling up/out of the program in ongoing, so the readiness of the private sector to embrace youth-led activities is yet to be fully tested.

It could be strategic to follow the evolution and outcomes of the scaling phase, even if it is done without direct IDRC funding, and to link it to initiatives of the SIE division targeting youth employment, as well as to the presence of agriculture in the curricula development initiatives supported by KIX.

One key remaining risk was the security situation in DR Congo. The project included activities in Eastern DR Congo where security concerns may compromise its operations. However, while DR Congo does experience civil unrest, the area in and around Bukavu in South Kivu, where the project worked, has been one of the countries' more stable areas. Activities will be conducted in and around schools that have security precautions in place. Luckily, there we no security incidents during the project.

Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

Being funded jointly by the International Development Research Center (Canada) and the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA), and IITA respected ethical requirements and procedures mandated by both institutions.

Responding positively to ethical concerns regarding the participation of minors – which was the main ethical risk identified in the PAD - The project fully embraced a do no-harm approach to field research. Opt-in and opt-out standard procedures were agreed in participatory way and followed consistently. The instructors and administrators in the eight secondary schools of focus helped with consensual clearance among the minors and assisted in the implementation of this surveys. The research team really appreciated the contributions of all these individuals, STEP personnel, IITA Scientists, and this appreciation gathered interest and increased participants' buy-in.

All students and instructors participated voluntarily in the program and could withdraw at any time. Their willingness to participate was checked on a regular basis, and even more frequently in periods of school closure during the Covid-19 pandemics, and not only at the beginning of the project activities. Their identity and privacy was respected and all reference to their personal information was left out of the project publications, communications, and outputs. Pictures used in publications and results were used only after open and clear consent and were chosen by students and teachers.

Parental consent was also sought and checked throughout the duration of the project. School boards and other teachers not participating in the program were kept abreast of the project activities and could comment at any time. No decline in students' performance in other subjects was observed that could be correlated to their participation in the project. In some cases, the students' performance in other subjects increased.

## Program Leader comments

Program Leaders (if project falls under one of the following programs: Animal Health, Climate Resilience, Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, Health Research Partnerships) should provide specific comments on the project, its activities, achievements, and contributions to the program.

## Director comments

The relevant Program Division or Regional Director should provide specific comments on the project, and to formally approve the report and its contents.

The future of agriculture, and therefore the transformation of food systems, relies on the next generation of farmers engaging in that transformation. In Africa, particularly with the youngest population on the planet, farming is still done by an older generation. The generational shift needs to understand the needs and aspirations of youth.

This project was one of the first attempts from CRFS to respond to this need. The new programming for CRFS in Africa needs to look at the results presented in this PCR to ensure best practices while engaging new generations.
