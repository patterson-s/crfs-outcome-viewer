PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

IDRC·CRDI

The livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers across the developing world are under threat from extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves, with risks projected to increase significantly in future years due to climate change. The anticipation of possible losses discourages farmers from making productivity-enhancing investments, trapping them in low-risk low-return agriculture. Agricultural insurance complemented with other risk-reducing practices can be a sustainable approach to unlock investments in agriculture for smallholders, improving their resilience and productivity. Crop insurance protects farmers against financial risks posed by extreme weather events and has been widely advocated as a tool to help farmer households to escape poverty traps and invest in climate-smart high-productivity agriculture. The number of successful insurance schemes targeting smallholders is however limited, for three reasons: high monitoring and verification costs of traditional insurance; low demand for index-based insurance—designed to eliminate the need to verify losses—mainly due to poor trust and basis risks (i.e. the imperfect correlation between farmers' actual losses and insurance payouts); and because insurance products are often designed neglecting complementary risk management options such as irrigation and drought-tolerant cultivars. This project aimed to overcome these problems by developing an innovative, climate-smart insurance product using a combination of satellite and smartphone imagery to assess actual crop yield losses and monitor on farm management practices. Ground pictures taken by farmers would help reduce monitoring costs and minimize basis risks. The project combined this insurance package with information and climate resilient technologies to understand how to adapt insurance premiums to farmers technology preferences. By taking pictures of insured crops, farmers engaged directly in the insurance process, improving trust. The project compared the picture and satellite-based insurance with the prevailing area and yield based insurance and assessed effectiveness in increasing productivity, resilience and food security of women, men and youth smallholder farmers in Kenya. The project was implemented by the Agriculture and Climate Risk Enterprise Ltd in collaboration with the International Food Policy Research Institute, Wageningen University and the Kenya Agriculture and Livestock Research Institute.

# PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

1. What are the five most important results (outputs or outcomes) of this project and how have they been useful or innovative?

1. Picture-based insurance (PBI): Traditional indemnity insurance products are too costly to implement for small-scale farms. Index-based insurance products, where payouts are related to an "index" that is closely correlated to agricultural production losses such as one based on rainfall, yield or vegetation levels (e.g. pasture for livestock), often fail to trigger payouts when farmers experience crop damage, due to a weak correlation between the insurance index and actual damage (i.e., basis risk). Capitalizing on recent advancements in technology, the project developed the picture-based insurance (PBI) product to assess individual crop damage from a stream of crop pictures uploaded by farmers themselves on the Seeitgrow, a mobile and web-based platform that farmers use to monitor the progress of the crops throughout the season. To join the cost-effective scheme, farmers dial a telephone code – using USSD technology – and follow prompts which guide them on purchasing crop insurance. The premium also offers farmers crop advice and information on regional weather conditions. Using smartphones, farmers submitted 65,000 images providing the testing ground for automation of assessments. For an acre of land, insurance cover worth KSh200 provided a payout of up to KSh2,000 in the event of weather-related crop loss, which helped farmers recover the initial investment paid to buy seed. In the short rains in 2021, 87 policies were sold, increasing to over 5,000 policies by the long rains through sensitization and raising awareness on insurance. The project developed a hybrid picture-based insurance (PBI) product, combining a weather index-based insurance (WBI) product for rating and pricing, with picture-based monitoring of crop conditions, to provide insurance coverage for visible

damage to crops. With this product, the basis risks was further reduced and payouts to farmers were more aligned to the losses they incurred due to weather damage.

2. Increased Insurance uptake: The results showed that providing PBI more than doubled smallholder farmers' take-up of insurance, with effects mainly concentrated among female farmers. PBI enhanced farmers trust in the insurance and improved perceptions of product quality and cost, a decision that lead farmers to also increase spending on inputs such as fertiliser and farm labour. Overall, this indicates that the improved coverage provided by PBI can increase demand for agricultural insurance compared to other insurance products, especially among women, and encourage farmers to invest more in their farms. Working with champion farmers the project managed to reach over 36,000 farmers (of whom 61% were female), provided 8,500 climate smart insurance policies, resulting in 3,672 insurance payouts (with a relatively larger number of payouts for female clients), and sold more than 600 packets of seed. However, given that only a few farmers have received an insurance payout by the end of the project, future research, with insurance offered over a prolonged period and more farmers receiving timely insurance payouts, would be needed to shed light on whether the innovation can also enhance productivity and profitability.

3. Gender-responsive insurance product design: PBI requires the use of a smartphone application to acquire images of insured crops and document crop growth throughout the season. To address the challenge of inequitable access of smartphone technology, the project employed the champion farmer model. Using female "champion farmers" with social networks within targeted communities, women were trained to market and distribute the product to their fellow farmers and to use smartphones to send in pictures of insured crops within their community. Female champions registered 21,321 farmers, 65% being female, while male champions registered a total of 14,986 farmers of whom 55% were female. This increased women farmers' access to high-quality seeds and new seed varieties. By working through champion farmers more women were reached despite concerns that women would not take up insurance implemented through smartphone technology. Qualitative research indicates that the opportunity to use a smartphone and receive a payout directly through one's own mobile money wallet (MPESA) held in the phone increased women's interest in the product. Willingness to Pay (WTP) decreased by 29% when payment was linked to a spouse's account and further reduced to 54% when made to a Rotating Savings and Credit Account (ROSCA). WTP fell substantially if the payout was controlled by someone other than the policyholder. This is important in the design of insurance policies that target women farmers, who are less likely to have their personal mobile money accounts. In addition, a complementary gender edutainment intervention developed by Mediae—producers of a popular TV show Shamba Shape Up—challenged existing gender norms and roles, and improved joint decision-making to help reduce instances of gender-based violence occasioned by control over assets.

4. Artificial Intelligence for crop Insurance: Automating image analytics is a crucial step towards achieving scalability and sustainability. One key challenge in insurance is delays in claims settlement due to the slow process of reviewing images by agricultural experts at the end of the season. Machine learning models were developed to automate verification due to drought, which is possible, with continuous model training to enhance transferability across seasons and crops. The project developed three machine learning models to automate classification of growth stages, types of damage and extent of damage, based on maize images. This is important in reducing the time needed to assess high numbers of photos and settle claims. With over 65,000 images submitted, automation of image analytics results confirmed that it is possible to automate image processing for claims settlement, with prediction accuracies of 75% for growth stage classification, 89% for visible drought classification, and 86% for the extent of drought predictions. Once enough images have been submitted, the technology will be tested on sorghum, green gram and bean crops. The project engaged an AI company from India,

DVARA, to further develop and test machine learning to improve accuracy and speed up assessments and payout of claims that will be a further boost for crop insurance.

5. Innovative and Lasting partnerships: The private sector has been largely engaged as third party partners especially where there are products to be developed. This project, however, had the private sector as the principle organisation and research organisations mainly as third parties. The project proved to be a great example of public, and private partnerships in implementing actionable and impactful research. ACRE Africa, as a private sector partner, brought in key expertise around insurance operations, bundling insurance with inputs, engaging with champions, and working with seed companies. The Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation (KALRO), as an agricultural research organisation, was important in facilitating the partnership with relevant ministries, building relationships with seed companies and KEPHIS (the seed regulator), and disseminating agricultural advisories to farmers to improve resilience. Wageningen and IFPRI, as researchers with a social science and economics background, provided critical thinking on the research design and put together the research tools building on their existing knowledge to provide evidence on how to strengthen the agricultural insurance sector. IFPRI was key in bringing expertise from experiences with picture-based insurance in India, and facilitating south-south learning and sharing experiences with the digital platforms. Through IFPRI, the project has established linkages with Indian firms; Dvara E-Registry and GESA in its insurance work to support ACRE with the automation of image processing and refinement of the digital platform. This partnership ensured that each partner brought its core function to bear on the project to be able to design a game changing product in the field of crop insurance that will benefit farmers well into the future.

## PROJECT OUTCOMES

## 4. How does the project contribute to the field of study / research area?

Why was this research important to fund? What were the key scientific findings? What occurred as a result of this project?

Weather hazards such as erratic rainfall cause significant hardship for smallholder farmers in Kenya and climate change is expected to further exacerbate farmers' vulnerability to extreme weather events. The anticipation of possible losses from these weather extremes discourages farmers from making productivity-enhancing investments, trapping them in low-risk yet low-return agriculture. The number of successful insurance schemes targeting smallholders is limited, however, for three reasons: high monitoring and verification costs of traditional insurance; low demand for index based insurance which is designed to eliminate the need to verify losses—mainly due to poor trust and basis risks (i.e. the imperfect correlation between farmers' actual losses and insurance payouts); and because insurance products are often designed neglecting complementary risk-management options such as irrigation and drought-tolerant cultivars. This project addressed those three concerns in different ways:

1. Accessible, affordable crop insurance: To manage verification costs, the project developed the PBI model using smartphone technology and an app downloadable from Google Playstore where farmers could upload the photos of their insured crops that were then assessed by agronomists at KALRO. By making use of advances in technology on remote sensing, image processing, machine learning, and smartphone ownership, the project reduced monitoring, assessment and verification costs that delay payouts for farmers and make insurance more costly. Champions also collected close to 65,000 crop images for seasonal crop monitoring, which were published online and are accessible here https://mlhub.earth/data/lacuna_fund_eotg_v1. The project managed to reach over 36,000 farmers (of whom 61% were female), provided 8,500 climate smart insurance policies, resulting in 3,672 insurance payouts (with a relatively larger number of payouts for female farmers), and got inputs in form of packets of seed into the hands of farmers to invest in their farms.

2. Gender equity: Smartphone access differs between men and women farmers, so too does an understanding of insurance and how it works. To ensure inclusivity of services and products, the project deliberately recruited a well-balanced mix of male and female champion farmers, representative of the target population. Champions were trained on various aspects of the project, equipped with smartphones, and engaged to help create awareness about the product, continuously train farmers on good agricultural practices, and collect demand for inputs. Using their social networks, Female champions were able to reach more women farmers (65%) than male champion farmers (55%), increasing women farmers' access to insurance, stress-tolerant quality seeds and new seed varieties.

3. Empowering livelihoods: Access to and control over income significantly disenfranchise female farmers. It is important to keep in mind this factor when designing insurance policies that target women farmers, who are less likely to have personal mobile money accounts. Their willingness to pay, controlling for other factors, might be lower than that of men, because of their relatively lower control over insurance payouts as with other farm supplies. The project made deliberate effort to change the narrative on control over income as an inducement for female farmers to take up insurance and used the Becker-DeGroot Marshak method where product cost varies based on the person controlling future payouts to test farmers' willingness to pay (WTP) for crop insurance. The first product would make a payout to a farmer's personal mobile money account, the second would make a payout to the farmer's spouse's account, and the third deposited a payout

in the farmer's Rotating Savings and Credit Association (ROSCA) account. There was substantial preference for payment into one's own account, and WTP decreased by 29% when payment was made to a spouse's account and 54% when a payout is made to a ROSCA. If payout is controlled by someone other than the policyholder, the willingness to pay dropped significantly. The project therefore ensured that women farmers registered for mobile money wallets and could directly access the insurance payouts to help them re-invest in their farms.

5. How would you compare the intended and actual results of the project? Why did it happen that way?

Were there any unintended outcomes of the project? Did the project evolve differently as detailed in the project approval document? Why did the unintended outcomes occur? What was the impact?

This project was looking to speed up the verification, assessment process of loss so the payouts to farmers can be done quicker which impacts positively on farmers perception of insurance, consequently increasing uptake. The verification process from the uploaded photos by farmers proved to be less costly, but it was still slower than desired therefore delaying payments. 65,000 photos for assessment were overwhelming for agronomists to cover and this would increase as more farmers take up insurance. Through IFPRI, the project hooked on to AI as the alternative for assessment and verification but also needed a lot of testing to be accurate for different types of damage for different types of crops and this slowed the implementation. The project could have had a higher rate of payouts for farmers with a more efficient assessment technology. The technology continues to be tested and will continue to be deployed to speed up assessment and verification even after project closure.

6. How did this project contribute to one or more of IDRC's strategic objectives?

Refer to the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan if the project was developed and implemented under the old IDRC strategy.

Refer to the 2030 Strategy if the project is developed and implemented under the new IDRC strategy. Provide specific numbers where possible.

Knowledge and innovation for large scale policy change: The risk factor in insurance for agriculture has prevented the insurance sector from fully being on board on crop insurance. This was a very timely project considering the climate change challenge - prolonged droughts, severe and frequent flooding and the losses that follow. It demonstrated that it is possible to reduce risk by use of technology that can ease the verification process and speed up payments. KALRO has also worked to have PBI included in the review of the Insurance policy to ensure that the technology can be commercialised and can be accessible to farmers and insurance companies alike. This will hedge farmers against losses of their crops thereby making them food insecure and sinking further into poverty. This policy will have great impact on the industry with the potential to transform insurance practice in the country and cushion farmers. The project is broadening its scope to Rwanda and Malawi as scale up countries to enhance uptake of insurance in East and Southern Africa.

It may be important in future to consider what contingency plans may work best for projects that have seasons should there be a shock that prevents a project from taking full advantage of a rain season or farming season on which the data depends. In addition, technologically heavy projects such as the PBI project need almost two timelines – 1 to develop the technology, the other to deploy as the development and testing constraints the deployment and the capacity for greater impact.

## STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

9. Were the risk mitigation strategies outlined in the Project Approval Document effective? Were there any unanticipated risks that affected the project?

Yes. COVID-19. Whereas an extension was granted for this project over 3 months, it was still very difficult to do a good comprehensive endline and the analytics that were needed given the tool used was also very complex. The data is there, just not as complete as previously envisioned.

10. Are there any lessons arising from the assessment and management of research ethics in the project? You may wish to comment on institutional ethics review process efficacy and capacities; institutional and research team ethics oversight throughout the project; ethics training in the project; role of the IDRC program team and ACRE as appropriate; unforeseen ethical issues and how they were managed.

No ethics issues arose in this project.
