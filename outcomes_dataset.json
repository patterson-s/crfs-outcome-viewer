Based on the experience with this ECF vaccine project, the team developed stronger project management practices including creating more robust milestones at project inception, conducting more frequent monitoring beyond annual reports, and taking into consideration all aspects of product development (including dedicated product profiles and targeted support for academic teams). The program approach of LVIF allowed the team to apply these lessons immediately across the portfolio, including the recognition that strategies for effective vaccine or manufacturing processes must be more ambitious and extend beyond laboratory work. This shift in practice represents evidence that IDRC's innovative risk mitigation approach is working, as demonstrated by the decision to discontinue funding until additional positive results are confirmed, reflecting standard R&D practices from the private sector.",

Women-led migrant networks demonstrated increased influence in subnational policy dialogues, with migrant women positioned as leaders of climate change adaptation whose voices directly influenced municipal and provincial policy decisions on climate, habitat, and housing issues. Southern researchers from Argentina and Costa Rica published multiple peer-reviewed articles in regional and international outlets (Routledge, academic journals in Costa Rica), demonstrating that southern scholarship on climate change, migration, and gender is gaining visibility and influencing academic and policy dialogues at regional and global levels.",

At the conceptual level, the research reconceptualized migrant women's unpaid care work to include environmental and nature care, expanding their recognized agency and territorial action rather than adding burdens, while making visible their knowledge about climate change impacts. At the institutional level, the project created a Municipal Ordinance for Democratic Management of the Caring City that embeds gender perspective as a guiding principle for habitat, housing, and city rights policies. The Diploma in Gender Environment and Territory trained 36 migrant women through 120 hours of coursework, strengthening their leadership capacities, decision-making power, and ability to lead productive projects and advocacy networks, turning them into agents of change and \"guardians of their own rights.\" The project substantially increased migrant women's involvement in political decisions at local and provincial levels, improved their access to rights, resources, and decision-making through an intersectional approach, and consolidated two young women researchers as Gender Climate Change leaders at national and international levels, demonstrating how women-led migrant networks can transform structural inequalities and advocate for community needs.",

Researchers isolated five new mycorrhizal strains endemic to Algerian soil, produced over 1,100 kg of mycorrhizae, and conducted greenhouse experimentation followed by extensive on-farm trials across different vegetable crops including olive trees, potatoes, tomatoes, and peppers. The testing demonstrated yield increases ranging from 32% to 55% depending on the crop, validating the effectiveness of this bio-fertilization technology as an alternative to chemical fertilizers. The project also conceptualized and piloted business models to facilitate large-scale adoption of the innovation, working with private sector actors to assess technical and economic viability for both producers and agricultural users.

The research tested multiple innovations through a discrete choice experiment (DCE), including bulk purchases of fruits and vegetables from local farmers, stokvel-owned vegetable gardens, and short courses on healthy food topics such as urban food gardening, nutrition, food preservation, and budget-friendly meal planning. The project also developed digital engagement tools including a social media community page (Facebook) to facilitate discussions about making healthier food choices on a budget, and created a webpage with practical resources such as recipes for healthy culturally salient meals and tips for storing fresh food. This systemic intervention explored an alternative approach in the South African food system targeting health and nutrition impacts in low-income communities, with findings showing that partnerships with local farmers and community-led agricultural initiatives could motivate stokvels to prioritize healthy food purchasing despite challenges with market power and initial lack of demand for healthy food access.",

Innovative session formats were piloted, moving away from traditional one-directional presentations to dialogical, co-produced, and embodied forms of interaction, with mentoring support, dedicated physical infrastructure (IT resources, flipcharts, movable tables), and a target ratio limiting traditional panels to 30% of sessions. The project tested a hybrid conference format with Regional Pavilions (Latin American/Caribbean and African pavilions) that enabled distributed participation while reducing carbon emissions, supported by 227 travel grants (100 to Global South participants, 120 to Canadian Indigenous people), connectivity grants, visa support, and adapted abstract review processes. Additional innovations included a mentoring program for early career researchers, dedicated Indigenous engagement protocols with an Indigenous-led partnership organization, and multi-sited dialogue workshops held across three distinct event formats (virtual, multi-hub, and hybrid) to evaluate different conference models through SWOT analysis. These innovations directly addressed systemic barriers faced by historically under-represented groups and resulted in 80-90% acceptance rates for session submissions from Latin America/Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa compared to 50-60% from North America/Europe.",

In Kenya specifically, the Ministry of Health received technical support to develop a Nutrient Profiling Model and Front-of-Pack Nutrition Labelling (FOPNL) system, and the project lead Dr. Gershim Asiki is now leading follow-on work (project 109865) providing technical support for development and implementation of up to four double-duty policy actions for healthier food environments. The research established legal and political feasibility for implementing child-directed marketing restrictions and simplified nutrition labelling policies across all three countries, with stakeholders in Uganda and Tanzania showing strong interest in developing similar policies. Additionally, the project's visibility and evidence positioned researchers to directly influence policymaking, with co-PI Prof. Karen Hofman's previous work having informed implementation of South Africa's sugar-sweetened beverage tax.",
