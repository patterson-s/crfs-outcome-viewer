This innovation involved bringing together different stakeholders from the livestock sector to co-create solutions and identify barriers to sector development. The project developed computerized dashboards as digital tools for exploring and analyzing animal disease data, and conducted two practical training workshops where livestock sector actors were initiated in using these dashboards to estimate disease-related losses in their specific contexts. Through these workshops, participants gained hands-on experience working directly with the tools, learning to collect, analyze, and interpret data effectively, while the project also updated and revitalized the database of the Directorate of Veterinary Services.",

The partnerships were characterized by balanced roles with six out of 11 researchers being women, including the PI and senior researchers across institutions. The project also sought to build partnerships with informal food retailers and community structures, representing efforts toward equitable collaboration with marginalized actors, though engagement with informal traders proved challenging. The extensive research output (14 peer-reviewed publications, 5 book chapters, policy briefs) and embedded capacity strengthening efforts demonstrated the effectiveness of these south-south collaborations for knowledge sharing on healthy and sustainable food systems.",

Policymakers developed understanding of the feasibility and implementation pathways for front-of-pack nutritional labeling (FOPNL) and child-directed marketing restrictions through legal feasibility studies conducted in all three countries. The Food-EPI tool application revealed to policymakers that existing food environment policies in Uganda and Tanzania show low progress against international best practices and require better implementation and accelerated development for NCD prevention. Cost-of-illness analyses provided decision-makers with evidence that diabetes imposes significant financial burdens on healthcare systems (US$620 million in Kenya, US$270 million in Tanzania, and US$3.8 billion in Uganda), incentivizing investment in prevention policies. Six policy briefs and baseline evidence on unhealthy food marketing to children in Kenya further informed decision-makers about critical food system issues including barriers to healthy food access, economic burdens of nutrition-related diseases, and food safety policy gaps.",

The research demonstrated the critical importance of gender-responsive design features, showing that women's willingness to pay for insurance decreased by 29% when payouts were controlled by spouses and by 54% when controlled by ROSCAs, informing future insurance policy design for women farmers who often lack personal mobile money accounts. KALRO worked to have PBI included in the review of national Insurance policy to ensure the technology can be commercialized and made accessible to farmers and insurance companies. The project showed how artificial intelligence and machine learning can automate crop damage assessment with 75-89% accuracy, reducing assessment delays and making agricultural insurance more viable, with potential for scale-up to Rwanda and Malawi.",

The Forum brought together heads of state, ministers, government officials, private sector leaders, civil society, donors, and researchers to discuss and debate innovative approaches for agricultural productivity, food security, and building healthier, more inclusive, sustainable, and resilient food systems. IDRC's thought leadership and investment enabled scientists and researchers to present evidence directly to policy makers and food system stakeholders at main sessions and side events, influencing national, regional, and global development agendas. The Forum played a pivotal role in shaping African perspectives for global dialogues, including the UN Food Systems Summit 2021, where over 40 game-changing solutions were profiled and immediate actions for agricultural transformation were identified.

Southern partners actively used the AgMIP tools and methodologies in real-world applications beyond the project, including assessing COVID-19 response measures' effectiveness on food systems in Senegal's Niayes region and informing agroecological transition planning in West Africa. The project also contributed to refining standard modeling tools used by the international research community (DSSAT, InfoCrop, and CropMaker) and filled a \"missing middle\" gap in modeling between regional and local scales. These innovations are now being used to inform multilateral and bilateral funding priorities, agricultural development plans, and proposals to the Green Climate Fund.",

Decision-makers including municipal candidates, government officials, and municipal councils gained improved understanding of territorial development priorities, environmental protection, and agro-ecological solutions through engagement with coalition-presented territorial development agendas. The project facilitated understanding of policy solutions across four territories, with coalitions successfully presenting agendas to government actors: in Mexico on environmental and forest protection integrated into land-use planning; in El Salvador on establishing a municipal Technical Agricultural and Livestock Unit with an agro-ecological vision; in Colombia on women's productive projects leading to cooperation agreements; and in Peru on supporting young farmers' business plans for family farming.

Key scientific contributions included two peer-reviewed articles published in international journals (Sustainability and International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health) examining pandemic effects on food security vulnerabilities and gender inequalities, plus three advocacy notes addressing health measures, women's resilience roles, and cross-border trade impacts. The research conducted an extensive PRISMA literature review that identified critical gaps in gender-differentiated pandemic impacts and documented how government restrictions (rather than the disease itself) disrupted food systems, forced illegal cross-border trade, and triggered a reconfiguration of gender power relations as women took on key economic roles. The project produced evidence-based policy recommendations for future pandemic responses that address local contexts, support food system resilience, and maintain gender equality gains, providing critical understanding not only of the COVID crisis but of future shocks to food security.",

Through a discrete choice experiment (DCE), the project tested specific innovations including bulk purchases of fruits and vegetables from local farmers, establishing stokvel-owned vegetable gardens, and short courses focusing on healthy food topics, with results indicating these were significant motivating factors for stokvels to prioritize healthy food purchases. The project involved women-led stokvels directly in developing and testing these innovations, providing crucial learning about the potential and limitations of stokvels as vehicles for improving food system access, though challenges emerged including lack of cooperation from key stakeholders and the realization that stokvels generally lack leverage against larger food system actors. The testing process revealed important insights about barriers to healthy food access, including perceptions of cost, preparation effort, and lack of awareness, while also identifying opportunities through partnerships with local farmers and capacity-building programs.",

The research demonstrated proof of concept that knocking out the IFITM locus in chicken embryonic fibroblast cell lines increased viral yields for influenza and Newcastle disease viruses without compromising antigenicity, with testing confirming 1-2.5 log10 higher yields compared to traditional embryonated chicken eggs. The team developed valuable research tools including DF1 single-cell clones with single IFITM knockouts, DF1 cells stably expressing flag-tagged IFITMs, and was the first to describe the antiviral roles, locations, and interactions of quail IFITMs with viruses.

Research outputs included 2 peer-reviewed journal articles, 3 research posters, 3 oral presentations at international and national conferences, 2 doctoral theses (on climate scenario development and agroecological adaptation practices), and 6 master's theses covering topics such as climate projections for cocoa agriculture, agroecological practices, and farmers' adaptation strategies. The project documented promising agroecological practices for climate adaptation using multiple criteria (economic, social/gender, and environmental), with findings particularly highlighting agroforestry, composting, and improved drying techniques. CEA-CCBAD significantly increased their knowledge and strengthened their capacity in climate scenario development, with these enhanced skills and results being shared throughout the WASCAL network across West Africa. The research generated important lessons about the critical role of cooperatives in helping smallholder farmers face external shocks and the role of agroecology in livelihood diversification and climate resilience.",
